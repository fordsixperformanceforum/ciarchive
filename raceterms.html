<td width="569"><div align="justify"><strong>Air box:</strong> Used primarily on Pro Stock Motorcycles, it settles “negative   air” around carburetors the way a hood scoop does on a car. </div></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><div align="justify"><strong>Air foil:</strong> the same as a wing — a stabilizer, generally used to create   downforce, which increases stability and tire-to-track adherence at high speeds.</div></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><div align="justify"><strong>Bang the blower:</strong> an explosion inside the supercharger caused by a   flame from the combustion process accidentally re-entering the supercharger,   where fuel and air are present. Generally caused by a stuck or broken intake   valve that normally would be closed during the combustion sequence.</div></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><div align="justify"><strong>Breakout:</strong> Used only in handicap racing, “breakout” refers to a   contestant running quicker than he or she “dialed” his or her vehicle (predicted   how quick it would run). Unless the opponent commits a more serious foul (e.g.,   red-lights, crosses the centerline, or fails a post-race inspection), the driver   who breaks out loses. If both drivers break out, the one who runs closest to his   or her dial is the winner.</div></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><div align="justify"><strong>Burned Piston</strong>: When a cylinder runs lean (too much air in the   air-to-fuel mixture) and excessive heat burns or melts the piston.</div></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><div align="justify"><strong>Burnout:</strong> spinning the rear tires in water to heat and clean them prior   to a run for better traction. A burnout precedes every run. </div></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><div align="justify"><strong>Bye Run: </strong>A lone run given to a randomly chosen car, because of an unequal   number of cars in the round.</div></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><div align="justify"><strong>Christmas Tree:</strong> see "Tree" </div></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><div align="justify"><strong>Clutch Can</strong>: The bell-shaped housing, or bellhousing, used to encase   the clutch and flywheel. </div></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><div align="justify"><strong>Clutch Lockup</strong>: The progression of clutch-disc engagement controlled by   an air-timer management system. </div></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><div align="justify"><strong>Deep stage:</strong> to roll a few inches farther into the beams after staging,   which causes the pre-stage lights to go out. In that position, a driver is   closer to the finish line but dangerously close to a foul start.</div></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><div align="justify"><strong>Dial-in:</strong> Also called an "Index". Your "Dial-in" time is the   absolute best (fastest) time you think your car can run. This is based on your   qualifying runs. This "Dial-in" is used during bracket racing, which allows cars   of very different performance to compete against each other.</div></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><div align="justify"><strong>Dial under:</strong> when drivers in Super Stock and Stock (handicap   categories) select an elapsed time quicker than the national index. Drivers   select a dial-under, or e.t., that they think their cars will run based on   previous performance. The breakout rule is in effect. </div></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><div align="justify"><strong>Diaper:</strong> an absorbent blanket made from ballistic material, often   Kevlar, that surrounds the oil pan to contain oil and parts in case of an engine   explosion; required for Top Fuel, Funny Car, Top Alcohol Dragster, and Top   Alcohol Funny Car. </div></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><div align="justify"><strong>Dropped cylinder:</strong> when a cylinder runs too rich (too much fuel in the   air/fuel mixture) and prevents the spark plug(s) from firing. </div></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><div align="justify"><strong>Elapsed time:</strong> the time it takes a vehicle to travel from the starting   line to the finish line. Also called e.t. </div></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><div align="justify"><strong>Eliminations:</strong> After qualifying, vehicles race two at a time, resulting   in one winner from each pair. Winners continue in tournament-style competition   until one remains. </div></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><div align="justify"><strong>Foul start:</strong> indicated by a red light on the Christmas Tree when a car   has left the starting line before the green light, or starting signal. </div></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><div align="justify"><strong>Full Tree:</strong> used in Competition, Super Stock, and Stock, for which a   handicap starting system is used to equalize competition. The three amber bulbs   on the Christmas Tree flash consecutively five-tenths of a second apart,   followed five-tenths later by the green starting light. A perfect reaction time   on a full Tree is .500. </div></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><div align="justify"><strong>Header(s):</strong> a fine-tuned exhaust system that routes exhaust from the   engine; replaces conventional exhaust manifolds. <br/>
</div></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><div align="justify"><strong>Heads-Up:</strong> Heads-ups racing is what we all grew up with. This is when two   vehicles line up and both vehicles leave at the same time. The first vehicle to   cover the distance is the winner.</div></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><div align="justify"><strong>Hemi:</strong> A Hemi engine has a hemispherical shaped cylinder-head   combustion chamber, like a ball cut in half. </div></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><div align="justify"><strong>Holeshot:</strong> when a driver reacts quicker to the Christmas Tree to win a   race against an opponent with a quicker e.t. </div></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><div align="justify"><strong>Hydraulic Lock:</strong> or Hydrolock, when a cylinder fills with too much fuel, thus prohibiting   compression by the cylinder and causing a mechanical malfunction, usually an   explosive one.</div></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><div align="justify"><strong>Index:</strong> the expected performance for vehicles in a class as assigned by   NHRA. It allows various classes of cars in the same category to race together   competitively.</div></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><div align="justify"><strong>Interval timers:</strong> part of a secondary timing system that records   elapsed times, primarily for the racers’ benefit, at 60, 330, 660, and 1,000   feet. </div></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><div align="justify"><strong>Methanol:</strong> pure methyl alcohol produced by synthesis; used in Top   Alcohol Dragsters and Top Alcohol Funny Cars. </div></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><div align="justify"><strong>Nitromethane:</strong> Produced specifically as a fuel for drag racing, it is   the result of a chemical reaction between nitric acid and propane. </div></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><div align="justify"><strong>Pre-stage:</strong> to position the front wheels about seven inches behind the   starting line so the small yellow lights atop that driver’s side of the   Christmas Tree are glowing. The next step is to stage and be ready to race. </div></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><div align="justify"><strong>Pro Tree:</strong> used in Top Fuel, Funny Car, Pro Stock, Pro Stock   Motorcycle, Top Alcohol Dragster, Top Alcohol Funny Car, Super Comp, Super Gas,   and Super Street, which feature heads-up competition. All three large amber   lights on the Christmas Tree flash simultaneously, followed four-tenths of a   second later by the green starting light.</div></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><div align="justify"><strong>Reaction time:</strong> the time it takes a driver to react to the green   starting light on the Christmas Tree, measured in thousandths of a second. The   reaction-time counter begins when the last amber light flashes on the Tree and   stops when the vehicle clears the stage beam (.500 seconds is a perfect reaction time because that is the time between each   of the lights on the tree). </div></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><div align="justify"><span class="style4B">Red Light</span><strong>: </strong>Another form of   disqualification is a foul start (or "red light"). This happens when the driver   reacts to the "Christmas Tree" too quickly and drives his car away from the   starting line before the green "go" signal. When dual infactions occur, say a   red light and then a break out, the red light takes precedent over the   break-out. </div></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><div align="justify"><strong>Return Road:</strong> Road that leads from shutdown area back to the pits or staging   lanes.</div></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><div align="justify"><strong>Shutdown Area:</strong> Area located after finish line for racing cars to   slowdown.</div></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><div align="justify"><strong>Sixty-foot time:</strong> the time it takes a vehicle to cover the first 60   feet of the racetrack. It is the most accurate measure of the launch from the   starting line and in most cases determines how quick the rest of the run will   be.</div></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><div align="justify"><strong>Slider clutch:</strong> a multi-disc clutch designed to slip until a   predetermined rpm is reached; decreases shock load to the drive wheels.</div></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><div align="justify"><strong>Speed trap:</strong> the final 66 feet to the finish line where speed is   recorded. </div></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><div align="justify"><strong>Staging:</strong> There are two sets of staging lights on the starting tree. When   staging, you move your vehicle up to the first (pre-stage) light beam. When you   are pre-staged the first light at the top of the starting tree will light. After   you and your opponent have pre-staged, you then move your vehicle ahead another   8 inches. This runs you through the second light beam at the starting line,   which lights the second Staging light, and you are now staged.</div></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><div align="justify"><strong>Staging Deep: </strong>or Deep Staging is done by pulling forward about 2 more inches   or until the Pre-Stage light goes off. By doing this it puts your vehicle closer   to the finish line which may give you a lower ET but it also results in a lower   trap speed. The main reason for deep staging is to get a lower reaction   time.<br/>
</div></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><div align="justify"><strong>Staging Lanes:</strong> This is the area were competitors take their vehicles so   they can be matched up for the upcoming round of competition.</div></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Staging Director:</strong> The person who directs the flow of traffic from the   staging lanes to the race lanes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Starting Line:</strong> The point of the starting area were both sets of pre-staging   lights are lit for your line.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Starting Light: </strong> see "Tree"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Supercharger:</strong> a crank-driven air/fuel-mixture compressor, also called   a blower. It increases atmospheric pressure in the engine to produce more   horsepower. </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Tech Inspection:</strong> Upon entering the pit area you will need to have a track   official inspect your car. They will check tires, steering, brakes or anything   that might pose a safety hazard. After your car is inspected you will be give a   number on your window. You are now ready to have some fun.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><span class="style4B">Tree:</span> Also called the "Christmas Tree", it is the noticeable electronic   starting device between the lanes on the starting line. It displays a   calibrated-light countdown for each driver. On each side of the Tree are seven lights: two   small amber lights at the top of the fixture, followed in descending order by   three larger LED lights, a green bulb, and a red bulb. </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Time Slip: </strong>A printed record of your run, given to you as you return to the   pit area after you run. Usually it is given to you on the return road.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Trap Speed:</strong> Trap speed is the average speed of your vehicle through the   last 66 feet of track.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Turbocharger:</strong> an exhaust-driven intake air compressor (see   supercharger).</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Wedge:</strong> an engine with a combustion chamber resembling a wedge in   shape. </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Weight transfer:</strong> critical to traction. Vehicles are set up to provide   a desired weight transfer to the rear wheels. Upon acceleration, the front   wheels lift and the weight shifts to the rear wheels, which makes them less   likely to spin. </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Wheelie: <span class="style3B">when the vehilce lifts the front tires off the pavement. </span></strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Wheelie bar(s):</strong> used to prevent excessive front-wheel lift. </td>
