<td bgcolor="#FFFFFF" height="128"><p align="justify" class="style3B"><strong>UPDATE 3-1-2011</strong> <br/>
<br/>
We we're hopping to release the big six aluminum cylinder heads  by the end of the summer, unfortunately the economy has forced us to keep the project on hold. As much as we'd like to move forward,  we simply don't have the funds to do so. Hopefully that will change in the near future, we'll just have to wait and see. <br/>
<br/>
While the patterns are  done, we still have a lot of work ahead of us. First we need to cast a couple heads, digitize an old cast iron head, then develop the CNC programming, which is needed to  machine the heads. This step alone could  take weeks, or even months. Once the prototypes are machined and the dimensions verified,  the cylinder heads need to be assembled and tested on a flow bench. Flow testing a new cylinder head is very time consuming and expensive. Each and every port needs to be  flow tested,  ported, and  tested again.  However making sure this step is done properly, and not rushed, is crucial  to the end result. If the flow test are unacceptable,  the patterns are modified and the process starts all over again. Cast,  edit  programming, machine and  assemble, and flow test again. This process  continues over and over, until we achieve the desired results, regardless how long it takes. </p>
<p align="justify" class="style3B">If and when the flow test are acceptable, we can move on to the next step, which is real-world testing. For this step, we'll cast, machine, and assemble a half  dozen cylinder heads, which will be tested under actual driving condition, on  a variety of  motors, ranging from completely stock to all out race applications. While the main goal is to  record changes in performance (HP and TQ) and mileage,  we'll  also  look at installation procedures (or problems), specifications (such as spark plug ranges), and  over-all reliability. Once we're confident the bugs have been sorted out, we'll give the thumbs up for the first production run. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<strong>UPDATE 4-7-2012<br/>
<br/>
</strong>While the cylinders are still on the back-burner, there is some hope at the end of the tunnel as it looks like the economy may be picking up. Our sales have been pretty good over the past three months, and if it continues like this for a few more months, we should  be in a position to start working on the cylinder heads again. Keep your fingers crossed..... </p>

                  the cylinder head and the   block.
                  The film turns   different shades of red, based on the clamping force applied, when the head is   torque'd down. The information is then entered into a computer, which in turn designs a gasket which is specifically suited to sealing the cylinder head for that particular application. The performance head gasket will  be particularly well suited for    our new aluminum cylinder heads, as well as 
                  all cast iron heads. They also utilize   Corteco's new White Seal Technology for unmatched sealing. </p>
