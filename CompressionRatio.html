<p align="left">If your building a performance motor, one of your first thoughts was probably 'How high should my Compression Ratio (C/R) be?" If so, you need to know the difference between Static Compression and Dynamic Compression, as Static compression is <strong>meaningless</strong> in itself. </p>
<p align="left">First, lets talk about the two types of compression ratios, Static (SCR) and Dynamic (DCR), and their differences. When most people talk about compression ratio's they are referring to an engines  Static compression ratio. The Static ratio  is a simple   concept and represents the ratio of the swept volume of the cylinder   (displacement) to the volume above the piston at top dead center (TDC).</p>
<p align="left"> For   example, if a hypothetical cylinder had a displacement of 450cc and a 50cc   combustion chamber, the CR would   be 500/50 (450+50/50), or 10:1. If we were to mill the head so that the volume above the   piston crown was decreased to 40cc, the CR would now be 490/40 (450+40/40), or 12.25:1.   Conversely, if we hogged the chamber out to 60cc, the CR would now be 510/60, or   8.5:1. Using these examples, it is easy to see how slight changes to the chamber volume dramatically effect the Static compression ratio, as well as the Dynamic compression ratio.</p>
<p align="center"><img border="2" height="334" src="images/CR1.gif" width="575"/></p>
<p align="justify">Everyone knows that high performance engines typically have higher   compression ratios. Why, because  higher compression ratios make more hp. Higher CR's also   improve fuel efficiency and throttle response. However, there are drawbacks to bumping the C/R to high. Simply put, once the CR exceeds a certain point, detonation occurs. Detonation   kills power and it kills the engine, literally. </p>
<p align="justify">The amount of compression a given engine can   handle is determined by many factors. These include combustion chamber design,   cylinder head material, the use of combustion chamber coatings, and so on. Once these mechanical   aspects of the engine have been fixed, the main variable is the octane of the fuel used. Higher   octane fuels offer increased resistance to detonation, or the ability to tolerate more   compression. However, there is a draw back,  higher octane fuels cost more money.  </p>
<p align="justify">With that in mind, you are probably wondering, how high should your C/R be? Even if you know all   about your engine and have decided what octane fuel you are going to use, the question   cannot be answered as phrased. Why? Because without reference to the camshaft   specs (where the intake closes), talking about the Static compression ratio is useless. <strong class="style3B"></strong></p>
<p align="justify">How is this so? Well, think about  how a four stroke   engine works. The power stroke has been completed and the piston is heading upwards   in the cylinder. The intake valve is closed and the exhaust valve is open. As the   piston rises it is helping to push the spent combustion gasses out the exhaust   port. As the piston reaches TDC and starts back down, the exhaust valve closes and   the intake valve opens. Fresh fuel and air are drawn into the cylinder as the   piston reaches bottom dead center (BDC) and starts back up. This is the critical   point as far as understanding the Dynamic compression ratio (DCR).</p>
<p align="justify"> As with all cam profiles, the intake valve is still open after BDC, and remains open as the piston begins its path upward.    Consequently, even though the piston is rising upwards in the cylinder,  compression does not actually begin until the intake valve closes (IVC). Once the intake  valve closes, and only then, will the air   fuel mixture begin to compress (DCR). Hence, the ratio of the cylinder volume when the intake valve closes, over   the volume above the piston at TDC, represents the Dynamic compression ratio. The   Dynamic CR is what the air fuel mixture actually "<span class="style4B">sees</span>" and it is what "<span class="style4B">counts</span>", not the   Static CR. Because DCR is dependent upon the IVC, the cam specs have as much effect on   the DCR as do the mechanical specifications of the motor.  </p>
<p align="justify">It should also be noted that the DCR is always  lower than the SCR. Most performance street and   street/performance motors, with a typical performance camshaft and a SCR of 10.0-12.0:1, will have a DCR in the range of 8.0:1 to 8.5:1. Any higher may   result in detonation problems with pump gas.            </p>
<p align="justify">Dynamic compression ratio should not to be confused with cylinder   pressure. Cylinder pressures change almost continuously due to many factors   including RPM, intake manifold design, head port volume and efficiency, overlap,   exhaust design, valve timing, throttle position, and a number of other factors. DCR is derived from measured or calculated values that are the actual   dimensions of the engine. Therefore, unless variable   cam timing is used, just like the static compression ratio, the Dynamic Compression Ratio, is fixed when the engine is built   and never changes during the operation of the engine. </p>
<p align="justify"> It is known  that most gas engines make the best power with a DCR   between 7.5 and 8.5 on 91 or better octane. A 355ci engine with a 9:1 static CR   using a 252 cam (110 LSA, 106 ICL) has an intake closing point of 52º after BDC and   produces a DCR of 7.93. The same  355ci engine with a 292 cam   (having an intake closing point of 72º ABDC) has a DCR of 6.87, over a full   ratio lower. </p>
<p align="justify">Hence the larger cam's DCR falls outside   the acceptable  range. It would have markedly less torque at lower RPM, primarily due to low   cylinder pressures, and a substantial amount of reversion back into the intake   track. Higher RPM power would be down also since the engine would not be able to   fully utilize the extra A/F mixture provided by the ramming effect of the late   intake closing. To bring the 292 cam's DCR up to the  desirable 7.5 to 8.5:1 for   a street engine, the SCR needs to be raised to around 10:1 to 11.25:1. </p>
<p align="justify" class="style3B">This   lowering of the compression ratio, due to the late closing of the intake valve,   is the primary reason cam manufactures specify a higher static compression ratio   for their larger cams: to get the running or dynamic CR into the proper   range.</p>
<p align="justify" class="style3B">Unless you have   actually measured the engine (CC'd the chambers and pistons in the bores), these   calculations are estimations, at best. Treat them as such. The published volumes   for heads and pistons can, and do, vary (crankshafts and rods, too). It is best   to error on the low side. When contemplating an engine with an 8.4 DCR or   higher, the measurements are essential, or you could be building another   motor.<br/>
<br/>
            Using this information, DCR is only a tool among   others, that a builder has available. It is not the "end all" in cam or CR   selection. However, the information provided is very useful for helping to match   a cam to an engine or an engine to a cam. It is still necessary to match all the   components in an engine and chassis for the best performance possible. Pairing a   292º cam with milled log head just won't cut it even if the DCR is correct, as the   cylinder head will never support the RPM capabilities of the cam. <br/>
<br/>
            Alternatively, with the SCR known, manipulate the cam specs until a desirable   DCR is found. When the best intake closing time is derived, look for a cam an intake closing timing, that provides the other attributes desired (lobe center and   duration). Often times the best cam is smaller than one might expect. Sometimes   a CR change is needed to run a cam with the desired attributes. </p>
<p align="justify" class="style3B">The information given here should be used as a guideline only. There are no   hard and fast rules. It is up to you, the engine builder, to determine the   correct build of your engine. And remember, unless accurate measurements are   taken,  calculations are only approximations. </p>
<p align="justify" class="style3B">We won't go into all the calculations required, as there are numerous programs available for handling that chore. We recommend purchasing one of these programs, if you are going to select the camshaft profile, and CR without the assistance of a trained professional. All cam manufactures are more than happy to assist you in selecting a cam profile if your not sure. However, with the available programs, it is actually quite simple. Or you can send the information to us and we will run the numbers for you, but  this does not allow you to play with the various options and setups, as you could if  you had your own program. Virtual Engine Dyno's Camshaft Utility Program, which calculates Dynamic CR, is only $20 bucks and can be  downloaded instantly. Their basic Engine Dyno program is $90 bucks, which includes the Cam Utility program. <br/>
<br/>
<a id="SDChart" name="SDChart"></a> To determine the Static compression ratio, you need the following information. Cylinder bore, crankshaft stroke, head gasket bore and thickness, piston dish size (if any), deck clearance, and cylinder head chamber size. To determine the Dynamic compression ratio, you'll also need to know the intake valve timing (when it closes). The Cam Utility program offered by Virtual Engine 2000, also gives you an estimated effective stroke which can be verified using a dial indicator when building your short block. </p>

<div align="center"><span class="style2B">The ideal DCR range for a performance motor on pump gas is 7.5 to 8.5</span><br/>
</div>
<div align="center">
<p align="justify">Now, lets use the charts to build a 200ci that is used as a daily driver. As such, we prefer good economy with    low to mid range performance, using low octane fuel.  Were also concerned about building the motor within a budget, so were going to maintain the log cylinder head with the 1V carb, maybe upgrading to a 2V carb. We'll also use the stock C4 tranny and torque converter, and the current 2:80 rear gears.  
              Since we are concerned about economy, we will be using  the stock dished pistons if possible. However, in this case, the machine shop has inspected the motor and informed us that 20 over pistons are required. That being said, we'll stay with dished pistons to optimize our mileage, and zero deck the block for better quench characteristic and a bit more compression. </p>
<p align="justify"> Next, using the <a href="cam_compare.html">cam specs</a>, we'll select  a short duration cam profile as they work best for  low compression motors (for economy). But not to short as we also want  one that allows more mid range performance for a little more get up and go. Looking at the specs,  our best choice  would be the 264 single pattern cam. But do we go with a 112 or a 110 lobe center? A 112 lobe center has the intake closing at 64 degrees and offers a smoother idle, while the 110 lobe center closes at 62 degrees and offers more low end grunt and a little bit of a lope. So which do we use? </p>
<p align="justify">This is where the dynamic compression ratio comes into play. Lets look at the <a href="200Z.html">chart</a> for an approximate comparison. Since we are building a mild performance motor, the chart will give us a pretty good idea. However,  if we were building a high performance  motor I would recommend purchasing a Cam Utility program for calculating precise numbers, rather than using approximations. </p>
<p align="justify">With our sample motor, we want to use  the chart for dished pistons, with a .020 over bore, and zero deck height. Since we are building a motor for the best possible economy, and want to use low octane gas, we need to stay in the green ranges,  or around 7.3 to 7.5 for the best performance. But wait, what about chamber size? We know our stock head has 62cc chambers, but looking at the chart, we see that the chambers are to big for the cam profile we selected. With the intake closing at 62 or 64 degrees (depending on the lobe center) and 62cc chambers, our DCR will be to low for good performance. </p>
<p align="justify">No problem. Lets move up the charts, looking for a chamber size that has the correct DCR and  valve timing for the cam profile we selected. 
                Remember, less static compression is better for an economy build, and  that you  want to leave as much meat on the cylinder head as possible, leaving room for another rebuild down the road. Therefore you want to find the first match with the IVC (intake closing) between 60-65 degrees, and the DCR in the 7-3 to 7.5 range. </p>
<p align="justify">Looking at the chart, it looks like a 52cc chamber is the first match, with the IVC at 62 degrees. Or a 50cc chamber with the IVC at 64 degrees. A 52cc chamber gives us a 9.06 SCR and an approximate 7.4 DCR using the 264 cam with a 110* lobe center. The 50cc chambers give us a 9.31 SCR and an approximate 7.5 DCR using the 264 cam with a 112 lobe center. </p>
<p align="justify">Therefore I would recommend using the 264 cam with a 112 lobe center. I would also   install the cam with 4 degrees of advance, to move the power band downward. This will give the motor a little more bottom end power and will get you out of the hole better with the current   2:80 gear set.  </p>
<p align="justify">Well that's it. All you  need to do at this point, is  instruct the  machine shop to mill the head for 52cc chambers. </p>
<p align="justify">OK, lets try one more. This one will be a 200ci that is used for occasional cruising, but see's the drag strip on a regular basis. We'll be using 93 octane fuel,  the new aluminum cylinder head,  flat top pistons, .060 over,  zero deck height, and a felpro gasket. In this case, we already have the cam from a previous build, which is a 274 with a 110 lobe center. What we want to know, is what size chamber will give us the best results,  keeping the DCR below 8.4 for a reliable motor with no detonation issues on 93 octane fuel. </p>
<p align="justify">Looking at the charts, we see that a 52cc chamber will give us a Static ratio of 10.17 and a Dynamic ratio of 8.42 if the intake closed at 60 degrees. With our existing cam, the intake closes at 62 degrees (rather than 60), so it should work out just about right. We need to mill our new aluminum head for 52cc chambers, which should be perfect for our build. </p>
