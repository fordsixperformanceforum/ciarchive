<br/>
<p align="justify">Here is a little clarification on how the "Load-O-Matic" distributor works, along with the  infamous "Spark Control Valve" (or SCV). Not only is it important to know how they work, especially if your planning a carb swap, but how they work in conjunction with each other.  <br/>
<img height="10" src="images/bullet%20clear.png" width="10"/><br/>
            The "Load-O-Matic"   style distributor was introduced in 1949 and was continued on all  V8's until   the 1967 model year. This arrangement was considered to be far superior to the   "vacuum brake" used on '32-'48 Ford V8's, as it used   a  combination   of manifold and venturi vacuum  to improve high speed performance. The   "Load-O-Matic"  was also used on  the Falcon Six due to it's "load   sensing" design, which   delivered good economy based on actual engine load for the day. 
            However the "Load-O-Matic" distributors are old technology, and while they may be OK for stock applications, they are a poor  choice for the performance enthusiast. <br/>
<br/>
            Unfortunately the "Load-O-Matic" distributors were designed for  simplicity and economy, rather than performance.  The primary reason for this, is that  the "Load-O-Matic" distributors have no provisions for mechanical advance. Instead they rely solely on relatively weak vacuum signals to sense changes in load and speed (rpm). As a result the  distributors are very slow to provide spark advance when the engine is accelerated under load, making them a poor choice for  performance  applications. This is also why we don't like the Petronics Ignition for anything other than  stock applications. While the Petronics Ignition may improve spark quality, your still stuck with the poor operation of the "Load-O-Matic" distributor, and  your carburetor choices are limited to those that are equipped with a "Spark Control Valve", such as the Autolite 1100.  Bottom line, if you want to improve  throttle response and overall performance,  you need to ditch the early "Load-O-Matic" distributor, swapping it for a late model or aftermarket distributor with mechanical (centrifugal) advance. <br/>
<br/>
<span class="style6B">VACUUM ADVANCE</span><br/>
            Manifold vacuum is
created  during the  down-stroke of the piston, which sucks air into the engine during the intake stroke. However it is only created when there is a restriction at the other end, such as a carburetor. 
 If the throttle plates in the carb are
 tightly closed and the pistons are moving quickly, a  high vacuum source is created. When the throttle plates are
cracked opened, there-by reducing the restriction,  less vacuum is created. If the pistons are moving slowly and
the throttle plates are wide open, manifold vacuum will be very close to zero. As such, manifold  vacuum is an excellent   source to determine how hard the engine is
working. This is called  "Load".<br/>
<br/>
            Let's go over this again..... When an engine is under   light load, the manifold vacuum   is high. However at wide open throttle, under heavy   load, the manifold vacuum will approach  zero, especially   when  the carburetor is properly sized. If the carb is to large for the application, manifold vacuum is reduced under all load conditions. In other words, "bigger is not better". </p>

<br/>
<span class="style4B">Ported Vacuum</span> is actually manifold vacuum, however it has   the ability to be switched ON or OFF.   To accomplish  this the vacuum port is positioned inside the carb body (not the venturi),   slightly above the throttle plate, when the plate is  in a close position.     At idle,  when the   throttle plates are closed,  the port is blocked off from manifold vacuum (OFF). 
              However as soon as the throttle plates  are cracked opened, the port becomes  exposed to
              manifold vacuum (ON).   As such, the throttle plates act like an "ON-OFF switch,  turning manifold vacuum OFF at idle, and back "ON" when 
              the throttle plates are cracked open. This is called "Ported Vacuum". <br/>
<br/>
<span class="style4B">Venturi Vacuum </span>is taken from the narrowest point in the  venturi chamber. As air enters the carburetor it passes through the  venturi chamber, accelerating at the narrowest point. When the air accelerates it creates a low pressure area,

If the motor runs better on ported, then use ported vacuum. If it runs better on manifold vacuum, that's fine too. There is no right or wrong answer. Try both and see which one your motor likes best. In general terms, ported vacuum results in lower emissions, while manifold vacuum  results in lower engine temps. It should also be noted that most engines idle a little higher on manifold vacuum, however this can be corrected by adjusting the idle speed on the carb.

<span class="style6B"><a id="SCV" name="SCV"></a>SPARK CONTROL VALVE</span><br/>
              Now that we have covered the differences in vacuum, we can talk about the "Load-O-Matic" distributor and how it works. In operation, the "Load-O-Matic" distributor and ignition system is very simple.  
               
            The Autolite 1100   carburetor uses a mixture of manifold vacuum (load) and venturi vacuum (speed) to supply the proper spark advance. As such, the "Load-O-Matic"  distributor has a vacuum circuit that   supplies manifold vacuum to the distributor. This is accomplished  by positioning  a vacuum port in the carb body slightly below (not above) the throttle plate, when  in a close position.     As such the distributor delivers   manifold vacuum advance to the ignition system, at idle and light throttle. <br/>
<img height="10" src="images/bullet%20clear.png" width="10"/><br/>
              As rpm's go up, manifold vacuum drops, and  the  vacuum signal becomes to weak to provide adequate  spark advance  at speed. Since   the "Load-O-Matic" distributors didn't have a provision for mechanical advance, like  most other  distributors, they had to find another way to compensate for high speed operation. This is where the "Spark Control Valve" comes into play. As the manifold   vacuum drops, the "Spark Control Valve"  closes, and the carburetor automatically switches over to venturi vacuum thru an internal passage in the carb. As the engine runs faster and inhales more air,  venturi vacuum increases,  sending  a stronger vacuum signal to the distributor. Hence the "Load-O-Matic" distributor advances to   meet the  demand for high speed operation.<br/>
<br/>
              The same  applies at "Wide Open Throttle" (load), when the throttle plates are fully opened. As manifold vacuum drops,  the "Spark Control Valve" closes, and the carb automatically switches over to venturi vacuum  to supply the proper vacuum signal. As such, the "Load-O-Matic" distributor advances to   meet the  demand under load. However, if the engine load is   light the engine needs even more advance as rpm's increase, for better fuel economy. Therefore, when the manifold   vacuum gets high enough, the spark control valve opens and control of   distributor vacuum advance passes back to the stronger manifold vacuum signal, thus meeting the need for more advance at high speed cruise. <br/>
<br/>
              Since the "Spark Control Valve" is proportional, the vacuum signal is   normally a mixture of manifold vacuum and venturi vacuum, rather than one or the other, therefore compensating for both load and speed. This vacuum arrangement is very simple and effective,   allowing the  "Load-O-Matic" distributor  to provide adequate spark advance in most   circumstances.<br/>
<br/>
              While this system may be  adequate for  stock motors, we highly recommend installing a Duraspark  or DUI distributor for improved performance.   The reason for this is quite simply to explain. The "Load-O-Matic" uses Venturi Vacuum and a vacuum canister, which reacts slowly   to the weak venturi vacuum signal. As such, the "Load-O-Matic" distributors are very slow to provide spark advance when the engine is accelerated under load. 
            The result is    soggy acceleration, which the "Load-O-Matic" distributors are notorious for. On the other hand, the Duraspark and DUI distributors use mechanical advance (centrifugal weights in the distributor) to compensate for changes in rpm, which immediately swing out   when   rpm is increased. This is also the reason we don't recommend the Petronics Ignition system. While the Petronics Ignition increases spark quality, your still stuck with the poor operation of the "Load-O-Matic" distributor. </div>
<p align="justify"><span class="style6B">VACCUM CANISTERS</span><br/>
<span class="style4B"><br/> 
              Load-O-Matic</span><br/>
            The "Load-O-Matic" distributor uses manifold vacuum to compensate for load,  venturi vacuum to compensate for speed,  and/or a combination of both, which is supplied by the Spark Control Valve.  We should also note that  venturi vacuum is a relatively weak vacuum signal, in comparison to manifold or ported vacuum.  The diaphragm in the vacuum canister is counter-balanced by two springs sitting at angles to each   other, which are visible when the distributor cap is removed. The springs   are attached to two  eccentric post, which can  be turned to adjust the advance curve. Therefore the "Load-O-Matic" vacuum canister replies on a combination of manifold vacuum and venturi vacuum to provide the correct amount of advance.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="style4B">Conventional</span> <br/>
              A conventional distributor uses    manifold or ported vacuum to compensate for load, and centrifugal weights to compensate for speed.  The weights are counter-balanced with  springs, which can be changed to adjust the advance curve. When an engine has a light load, the vacuum   signal is high, whereas at the highest load or wide open throttle, the vacuum signal will approach almost zero. As such the vacuum canister on a conventional distributor, sensing manifold vacuum only,  adds more advance when cruising and less   to none when you have the "pedal to the metal". On the other hand, the centrifugal weights continually increase  the spark advance as rpm's increase. <br/>
<br/>
<span class="style4B">NOTE:</span> The spark   control valve looks a lot like a Holley power valve. It works like a   power valve, but instead of passing fuel, it passes air.</p>

<p align="justify"><strong class="style6B">MIXING IT UP  </strong><br/>
              The "Load-O-Matic" distributor and the "Autolite 1100" carburetor were designed to work together, therefore i<span class="style3B">f you're doing a carb swap,  more than likely you'll need to swap  the distributor as well.</span> Failure to do so will result in an engine that runs poorly, especially during  acceleration. <br/>
<br/>
<span class="style4B">                  Distributor Swaps </span><br/>
              The "Load-O-Matic" distributor uses the  "Spark Control Valve" (a spring and diaphragm mechanism), to determine the proper amount of vacuum advance, which is commonly a mixture of manifold vacuum   (sensing load) and venturi vacuum (sensing rpm). On the other hand,  a conventional distributor uses  mechanical weights (speed) and manifold vacuum (load), to provide the proper amount of   ignition advance for any given  situation.<br/>
<br/>
              While you can use a Duraspark or  DUI  distributor   with a  stock Autolite 1100 carb, both  of these  distributors utilize  a mechanical advance mechanism that was    designed to operate with ported or manifold vacuum. As such  they will not operate properly using the vacuum port on the stock Autolite 1100 carburetor. To correct this you need to plug the port on the carb, so you don't have a vacuum leak, and run the vacuum line from the Duraspark or DUI distributor to a manifold vacuum source. This can be accomplished using an existing vacuum source on the intake manifold, or the bottom of the carb adaptor. Or you can create a new source by drilling a hole in the intake manifold and  installing a vacuum barb. However, you'd need to remove the cylinder head before drilling,  to make sure the manifold is free of any debris that could work down into the cylinders and severely damage the motor. <br/>
<br/>
              So...what happens if you do try to use the vacuum port on the Autolite 1100 carb?  
               At idle, the "Spark Control Valve" is open, sending manifold vacuum to the distributor. As such, the engine will idle just fine. However 
            the "Spark Control Valve"  will not provide the proper vacuum signal  under load and/or speed. All engines need more advance when cruising, and less   to none at wide open throttle. However since you are now using the carb (venturi vacuum advance) and the distributor (mechanical advance) to compensate for speed,  the ignition system will receive to much advance at cruise and wide open throttle. As a result, the engine may chug and jerk from the over-advanced condition at cruise.  <br/>
<span class="style4B"><br/>
            Carburetor Swaps </span><br/>
            If you're swapping carbs, there's a very good chance you'll need to swap the distributor as well. The "Load-O-Matic" distributor  was designed to work with a "Spark Control Valve", which to my knowledge, was only found on the Autolite 1100 carbs. The only exception to this is the new Vaporizer carb, which we will discuss momentarily. <br/>
<br/>
            Most carbs, like the popular 32/36 Weber DGV, the Holley 350 or 500, or any of the Autolite 2BBL carbs, are designed to supply ported vacuum. Therefore the engine would idle just fine. However since neither the carb or the distributor have any means of sensing rpm's (or speed) the distributor cannot  provide the proper amount of spark advance at cruse. With the spark advance severely retarded, the engine would  lack power, run very poorly, and suffer from poor gas mileage. <br/>
<br/>
            As we explained earlier, installing a newer carb with a   "Load-O-Matic" distributor should  be avoided.  
            However the one  exception to this rule   is the new Vaporizer, since it's   offered with (or without)  a "Spark Control Valve", depending on the model year. If you plan to keep the stock "Load-O-Matic" dizzy you would need to order the 63-67 Vaporizer, since it  comes with  a "Spark Control Valve" and  designed to work with the "Load-O-Matic" distributor.   However if you plan to swap the distributor you'd need to order the 68-69 Vaporizer, since it comes without the "Spark Control Valve", which is designed to work with the stock 68-69 distributor.   Another option, although extreme, would be to plug off venturi vacuum port so the carburetor supplies manifold vacuum only.

<span class="style4B">NOTE: </span>Installing a Petronics Ignition in the "Load-O-Matic" distributor makes no difference in the outcome. If you keep the "Load-O-Matic" distributor, you <strong>must </strong>use  the stock Autolite 1100, or the early (63-67) Vaporizer with a "Spark Control Valve".<br/>
<img height="10" src="images/bullet%20clear.png" width="10"/><br/>
<span class="style4B">NOTE:</span> If you swap the carb to anything other than an Autolite 1100, or the early (63-67) Vaporizer, without a "Spark Control Valve", you <strong>must</strong> swap  the distributor as well. <br/>

<span class="style4B">NOTE:</span> If you install the popular 32/36 Weber DGV or an Autolite/Holley 2V carb, you <strong>must</strong> swap the distributor as well. You'll need a distributor that has    provisions for mechanical advance, and   designed to operate with ported or manifold vacuum. <br/>
<br/>
<span class="style4B">NOTE:</span> When hooking up your vacuum advance, we recommend  manifold vacuum  whenever possible. However that being said, we have seen a few motors that actually ran better using ported vacuum. As such, you might   want to try  manifold vacuum first, then switch to ported vacuum, and see which works best for your application.

<p align="justify"><span class="style6B">COMMON PROBLEMS</span><br/>
              Typical problems with the "Load-O-Matic" distributor and/or the Autolite 1100 carb include leaky   vacuum lines, failed or stuck "Spark Control Valve", clogged  vacuum passages, worn out distributor advance plates, or  worn out vacuum   advance diaphragms. Any of these problems or failures can lead to a lack of full spark advance, causing   poor performance, poor gas mileage, and potential overheating.            </p>
