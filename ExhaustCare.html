<p>High-performance mufflers and exhaust systems are as much about looks and sound   as they are about horsepower. Most people want  mufflers and exhaust systems that look and sound as good as they perform. That's easily accomplished when the parts are new, but how about two or three years down the road? <br/>
<br/>
              Keeping your headers and exhaust system looking like new, is a simple task that is often overlooked or  disregarded. However, those that take the time to properly clean and polish  these components, not only have an engine bay they are proud to show off, they  greatly   extend the service life of their exhaust components. While  valve covers and oil caps are cheap to replace, custom headers and/or exhaust systems can be very expensive items. Especially if they are ceramic coated, chromed, or made from Stainless steel. Therefore it is essential to provide proper maintenance on a regular basis. In this article, we  explain how to maintain the various finishes and materials that are commonly used in exhaust systems. </p>
<p><span class="style4B">TIP:</span> Preventative maintenance includes checking for loose or missing fasteners,   gasket leaks, and checking the over-all condition of the exhaust system, including  pipe hangers,  exhaust clamps, and flange connections. <br/>
<br/>
<span class="style4B">TIP:</span> Exhaust system corrosion will occur if moisture   (condensation) is present in the exhaust system.  Make sure that the   vehicle is driven at least 20 to 30 minutes, when ever the car is started, to   completely eliminate any moisture that is created by the combustion process.  Failure to do so may result in the pipes rusting   from the inside out (excluding   stainless steel). <br/>
<br/>
<span class="style4B">TIP:</span> Header coating damage usually occurs during the first engine break-in period, when the   exhaust temperatures often exceed 1200°F. due to  excessively lean or  rich air/fuel mixtures and/or   incorrect ignition timing.  For this reason we strongly recommend using an   old set of headers or your stock  cast iron manifold for your first engine run-up or break-in. Prior to installing your coated headers, make sure the air/fuel mixture and ignition timing are properly set. Also remove any fingerprints, grease, oil, or any foreign material before, starting the engine, which  prevents the possibility of baking them on, permanently.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="style4B">TIP:</span> <span class="style3B">When storing your car for an   extended period of time,</span> park the car over a large sheet of plastic or a tarp.  This will protect your car, headers, and exhaust system from moisture seeping up through the floor or the ground.  Wipe down  the   headers and dry thoroughly, then coat the headers with WD-40. Pay particular attention to the areas where the   tubes are welded to the header flanges and where the tubes come in close   proximity to each other (especially where the tubes enter the   collectors).  These areas are prone to rusting, as most coatings are unable to get   between the tubes in these areas, during the coating process.  If rust occurs, it will   travel into and under the coating.  When you are ready to   start the car after storage, remove  the WD-40 by following the appropriate cleaning   procedures below.</p>

</span></div></td>

</table>
<div align="justify">
<p>                While  powder coatings are more durable than spray paint, proper cleaning methods must be observed to maintain the appearance. Never<strong> </strong>use any type of solvent, steel wool, scouring pads,  or    strong de-greasers to clean powder coated headers. Solvents or strong cleaning materials may lift the paint, as will <strong class="style3B"> </strong>gasoline, brake fluid and other chemicals, which must be wiped off immediately. Even then, it may be too late. <br/>
<br/>
                  Prior to cleaning, rinse off any loose dirt with clean water, then use  a mild detergent and warm water, or a non-solvent   based cleaner (such as Simple Green), with a soft non-abrasive cloth or  sponge, to clean   the surfaces.   When you are finished cleaning,  rinse again with plenty of clean water and dry  thoroughly.<br/>
<br/>
                Touching up  small scratches and nicks is very important to the maintenance and care of powder coated headers. Any spot where bare metal is  exposed, no matter how small,  becomes a breeding ground for rust. If left un-checked,  the rust  can   spread into or under the coating, eventually turning the header into a mass of twisted junk.  <br/>
<br/>
                  Touch-up should only be done to repair minor surface scratches and  nicks.   Don’t try to use touch-up paints to fix large scratches, or areas that have corrosion problems. Your  best bet  at that point, is to strip the part and start over. While there are many liquid touch-up paints available for powder coated finishes, it may be difficult to find touch-up paint that's  suitable for  high temp applications. Choosing a  touch-up paint should only be done after   consulting the powder coat formulator, which  ensures compatibility.  If you don't do this, you risk lifting the paint,   or having adhesion issues.  Bottom line, choose   a touch-up paint  you can  apply,   make sure it has the same level of performance as the original coating, and do your utmost to ensure compatibility. <br/>
<br/>
                  The best product for blending touch-ups or light surface blemishes, is  3M’s Finesse, which is available at most   auto body supply stores.<br/>

<p align="justify">Ceramic coatings are highly durable and will last for many years with proper   care. However the durability and appearance  is usually determined by the tune of your   engine and proper maintenance.  Excessive exhaust gas temperatures, caused by  improper fuel/air mixtures (too rich or too lean),  incorrect ignition timing, and/or excessive   boost, can severely  dull the appearance, and may result in Flaking. While it may be possible to restore the appearance  by polishing,  excessive damage normally requires re-coating the header. <br/>
<br/>
        Never<strong> </strong>use any type of solvent, steel wool,   paper towels, scouring pads, scratch removers (unless clear coat safe), or    strong de-greasers to clean silver ceramic coatings. Solvents and strong cleaning materials can    dull the shine,  and may damage  the coating. <strong class="style3B">Wipe </strong>gasoline, brake fluid and other chemicals   from the coated parts as soon as possible. <br/>
<br/>
        Prior to cleaning, rinse off any loose dirt with clean water, then use  a mild detergent and warm water, or a non-solvent   based cleaner (such as Simple Green), with a soft non-abrasive cloth or  sponge, to clean   the surfaces.   When you are finished cleaning,  rinse again with plenty of clean water and dry  thoroughly. <br/>
<br/>
        To polish ceramic coatings <strong class="style3B">use </strong>a soft cloth and a non-abrasive metal polish. We recommend "<span class="style4B">Cermaglow Metallic Ceramic Polish</span>" which is available from Eastwood, or <span class="style4B">Wenol</span> <span class="style4B">Metal Polish</span> (see below). To remove  small scratches or scuffs, use  <span class="style3B">a</span><span class="style4B"> "clear coat safe"</span> chrome polish or   scratch remover. <br/>
<br/>
<strong>TIP:</strong> Anytime you work on ceramic coated headers, wipe them down with a non-solvent   based cleaner (such as Simple Green) and a soft cloth, and allow  to dry thoroughly before starting the engine. </p>

</table>
<p align="justify">            Chrome is highly functional,   resists tarnishing, and outshines just about any other   finish. Yet,  as tuff as it is, chrome will oxidize, rust, and  pit. There's nothing more   discouraging than a pitted valve cover or header, in an otherwise neat and well organized engine bay. 
              However, with proper  maintenance and a quality metal  polish, this can be prevented.   <br/>
<br/>
              Prior to cleaning, rinse off any loose dirt with clean water, then use  a mild detergent and warm water, or a non-solvent   based cleaner (such as Simple Green), with a soft non-abrasive cloth or  sponge, to clean   the surfaces.   When you are finished cleaning,   rinse again with plenty of clean water and dry  thoroughly. Polish if required.<br/>
<br/>
              Polishing is extremely important, as it removes the surface oxidation that   feeds rust. Polishing  compounds can also be used to buff out small scratches and blemishes, that if left   unchecked, become breeding grounds for rust. 
              <span class="style3B">While there are many excellent  products available, we recommend<strong> Wenol Metal Polish</strong></span> (see recommended products below). <span class="style4B">Blue Job</span> is recommend for removing the  bluish tint found on chrome parts which have been exposed to heat. <span class="style4B">Never-dull Wadding Polish</span> also works  well, especially for small touch-ups. <br/>
<br/>
<strong>TIP:</strong> Anytime you work on  chrome headers, wipe them down with rubbing alcohol and a soft cloth, and allow  to dry thoroughly before starting the engine. </p>

</span></div></td>

</table>
<div align="justify"><br/>
<strong class="style3B">Aluminized steel</strong> is normally carbon steel that has   been hot-dip coated  with an aluminum-silicon alloy.   The coating process assures a tight metallurgical   bond between the steel tubing and the aluminum coating, producing a material   that has a unique combination of properties that neither steel or aluminum can offer on their own. Aluminized steel offers improved corrosion resistance, however once the coating has been damaged, it can not be repair. As such, the best maintenance, is preventative maintenance. In other words, use what ever precautions are necessary, so as not to scratch the  coating during installation. <br/>
<br/>
        Never<strong> </strong>use any type of solvent, steel wool,   paper towels, scouring pads, or     de-greasers to clean Aluminized steel. Solvents and strong cleaning materials  may damage  the coating. Use  mild soap and water, or a non-solvent   based cleaner (such as Simple Green), with a soft non-abrasive cloth, for cleaning. Never polish Aluminized steel, simply clean and wipe dry. 
              We have heard that "Never-Dull Wadding" works, however we've never tried it, so we can't say for sure. I would suggest trying it on a place that isn't visible, just in case. <br/>

<br/>
<p align="justify">            Unlike chrome, Stainless steel won't rust or pit, unless exposed to excessive amounts of road salt, however it will oxidize and change color over time. This is normally due to the various  compounds used to clean and polish Stainless steel. Many polishing compounds  are comprised of various types of metal, which are ground into very fine particulates. These particles   become   embedded in the microscopic pores,    which eventually oxidize and turn  a yellow/gold  in appearance. <br/>
<br/>
            For routine cleaning,  rinse off any loose dirt with clean water, then use  a mild detergent and warm water, or a non-solvent   based cleaner (such as Simple Green), with a soft non-abrasive cloth or  sponge, to clean   the surfaces.   When you are finished cleaning,  rinse again with plenty of clean water and dry  thoroughly. <br/>
<br/>
            For stubborn stains, oil and grease, use organic solvents such as acetone,  methylated spirits,  alcohol, or specialty stainless steel cleaners. Use a rag, sponge, or    old toothbrush for cleaning in tight places. Do not use ordinary   steel wool,  iron particles can become embedded in stainless steel and cause   more problems. Stainless steel or Scotch-brite scouring pads are recommended.    When finished,  rinse well with  clean water and wipe dry. <br/>
<br/>
<span class="style3B">While there are many excellent  products for polishing, we recommend<strong> Wenol Metal Polish.</strong> </span>It does a great job on Stainless steel  and  is  strong   enough to remove tough stains, surface oxidation, surface rust, and  water spots. <strong> </strong><span class="style4B">Blue Job</span> is recommend to remove  bluing. </p>

              Wenol was developed in Germany over 30 years ago and still remains one of the best   polishes you can use on hard metals. Everyone from antique dealers, to mechanics, to   the U.S. military, use Wenol to remove tarnish and rust, and to restore a   sparkling shine on a variety of metal items.
              Wenol is one of the most trusted and widely used   metal polishes on the market, because it really works, and it's safe to use on all     metals as <strong><span class="style3B">it</span></strong> contains no toxic or acidic ingredients.<br/>

<strong> Wenol</strong> <strong>Red </strong>was   designed to clean, polish, and preserve bare metal surfaces.  It    removes heavy oxidation and tarnish from brass, copper,   chrome, aluminum, pewter, stainless steel, and painted enamel finishes.  Simply apply a small amount of Wenol Metal Polish to a damp  polishing cloth, and rub gently. On tough stains, rub slightly longer, not harder. Then use a soft dry cloth to buff off the residue. Once you’ve   removed the blemishes, use <strong> Wenol Blue </strong>to <span class="style3B">achieve a brilliant   shine, and   to protect the metal from corrosion and water spotting.</span></p>
