<p align="justify" class="style3B"><span class="style4R"><a id="2" name="2"></a>1) Why do Autolite Carbs require less maintenance? <br/>
</span>Autolite carburetors will    virtually run forever, or at least until dirt gets into  the carb. Due to the one piece base, there are no   gaskets to dry out, crack, and/or more importantly,  leak. Not only does this result in lower maintenance, it greatly improves fire safety, especially when the carb is sitting  directly over the exhaust manifold or header, as is the case with our inline sixes.<br/>

<a id="3" name="3"></a><span class="style4R">3) Why should I   buy an  Autolite carburetor from Classic Inlines?</span><br/>
        Our rebuilt carburetors are completely disassembled, including   the throttle shaft and choke assembly, then   soaked, media blasted, polished and/or re-plated when necessary. Once the parts have been thoroughly cleaned and inspected, the carbs are re-assembled using the highest quality kits available. Finally, the carburetors are re-calibrated and adjusted to overcome    the inherent  problems that were common with the factory OEM carbs, such as hesitations, flat spots under acceleration, and hard    starting. Our   rebuilt carbs come with a new manifold gasket, a phenolic spacer, timing &amp; installation instructions,  and a  one-year warranty (from date of shipment). <strong><br/>

<span class="style4R"><a id="4" name="4"></a>4) Is bigger   really better, or a myth?</span><br/>
              For   years, people have had the notion that  "bigger is better”. That concept is simply not true. When an oversized  carburetor is installed, low end performance suffers without any   appreciable gain in top end performance. An oversized carburetor will run “lean” off idle   through the normal range operating range and then dump too much fuel at the top   end, and run “rich”. On the other hand, a correctly sized (and functioning) carburetor will provide   a constant air/fuel ratio through most of the operating range. <br/>
<img height="10" src="images/bullet%20clear.png" width="10"/><br/>
              The idea is to choose a main body with a large enough bore and venturi area   to allow maximum airflow through the carburetor, based on the engines requirements.  At the same   time, the venturi must be properly sized (small enough) to promote a high-speed   airflow signal to the carburetor. This signal is a measurement of air speed that the carburetor   reads in order to determine how much fuel to deliver into the incoming air stream.   In theory, if the bore and venturi are too large, the signal will be weak at low   engine speeds and the fuel will not be pulled from the carburetor's discharge   ports accurately. The opposite of this effect is when the carburetor's bore and   venturi are too small for the engine's airflow demands. While throttle response   will be outstanding, the engine's maximum airflow, or power potential, is   diminished. The ideal carburetor is large enough to move the   maximum amount of airflow through the carburetor, yet small enough to maintain the strongest   possible airflow signal.<br/>
<img height="10" src="images/bullet%20clear.png" width="10"/><br/>
              Therefore, it is very important to use a <a href="CFMcalc.html">CFM calculator</a>, thus ensuring you have selected the proper size carburetor for your CFM requirements. However, it should also be noted that the calculated results are just that, calculated. Once you have done the calculations, consider the following "Rules of Thumb" before you make your  final decision. Just remember, it's always better to <u>start small</u>. </p>

<p align="justify" class="style3B"><span class="style4R"><a id="5" name="5"></a>5) How does the choke   system work?</span><br/>
            When the engine is cold (at   ambient air temperature), press the gas pedal all the way to the floor to close the choke plate. This reduces air flow and richens up the A/F mixture for starting. Next,   pump the gas pedal once or twice, to  provide   the initial charge of fuel required to start the engine, then hold the gas pedal down about half way.  Once the engine starts, the   choke unloader will automatically open the choke plate about 1/8”, providing a slight  increase in air flow, there-by leaning out the mixture.  From there,  the air flow requirements  continue to increase as the engine   heats up, eventually requiring the choke plate to be in a fully opened position. This is done either manually or automatically, depending on the type of choke mechanism used on the carb. A manual choke requires the driver to open the choke plate by means of a choke cable, whereas an automatic choke does it automatically.  Some carbs use an electric or hot water choke, but most Autolite carbs use hot air to open the choke plate. (the hotter the air, the wider the choke plate opens).  Hot Air Chokes use heat produced from a heat riser tube (also called a hot air choke tube) which brings hot air up from the exhaust manifold or header. This hot air heats up a bi-metal spring inside the black choke cap, and as    the spring heats up, it unwinds and gradually opens the choke plate to a   fully opened position, allowing more air to enter the carb. <br/>
<img height="10" src="images/bullet%20clear.png" width="10"/><br/>
<span class="style4R"><a id="6" name="6"></a>6) Do I need really a   choke?</span><br/>
            We have people   from warm climates tell us  that they don’t need a choke system, however this is simply not true, even if the outside temperature is 80 or   90 degrees  in the morning. The cylinder walls, pistons and valves inside   your engine are going to be the same temperature, or even a little colder, when the engine is cold. On the other hand, when   the engine is at full operating temperature, it's approximately 600 degrees. As such, the   fuel requirements of a cold engine (90 degrees is cold compared to 600 degrees),   are dramatically different than they will be when the engine is at full operating   temperature. In the first ten seconds of operation, the engine needs twice as   much fuel than when it is hot, and for that  reason, a choke assembly   should be used on all carburetors. <br/>
<img height="10" src="images/bullet%20clear.png" width="10"/><br/>
<span class="style4R"><a id="7" name="7"></a>7) What is an   Automatic Hot Air Choke?</span><br/>
            Hot air is provided by a Heat   Riser Tube (also called a Hot Air Choke Tube), which is connected to  the exhaust manifold or header. In a stock application, this is a   SEALED system, therefore there are no exhaust gases traveling through the choke   tube. Instead, it draws cold air from the air filter into   one end of the exhaust manifold. The heated air is then piped to the choke assembly by means of an insulated Heat Riser Tube, which  warms the bi-metal spring in the choke cap,  which in-turn unwinds and opens the   choke plate. This process, at 40 degrees, takes 5-7 minutes, which happens to   be about how long it takes your engine to reach it's normal operating temperature. We like   hot air chokes because the full opening of the choke plate corresponds with the   time that it takes for an engine to reach it's normal operating temperature. <br/>
<br/>
            What happens if you have an Autolite carb and you install a set of  headers? That's OK too, you can still use   an automatic hot air choke. Instead of using the factory pre-bent stainless steel choke   tubes that press into the exhaust manifold, we offer an extra long   bendable insulated tube that clamps to the outside of the header pipe.  These <a href="proddetail3af2.html?prod=PCA%2D200%2DHCT&amp;cat=53">Hot Air Choke Tubes</a> are   available from Classic Inlines and can be ordered separately, or as an option when ordering a carb and/or headers. The open   end of the tube, which is clamped to the header, pulls in fresh air which is heated and drawn  up to the black choke cap in much the same   way as the original tube. The only drawback is that the open end may draw in dirt, which could clog the choke assembly and prevent it from working properly. As such, we are working on a new choke tube which will be even longer, and will draw fresh air from the base of the air cleaner, there-by keeping out any dirt that could enter and clog the choke assembly. </p>
<p align="justify" class="style3B">NOTE: Hot air chokes were only used on Autolite carbs. All other carbs, including Weber,  Holley,  Carter,  Edelbrock, Stromberg, and every other carb I can think of,  used manual, electric, and/or hot water chokes. <br/>
<img height="10" src="images/bullet%20clear.png" width="10"/><br/>
<span class="style4R"><a id="8" name="8"></a>8) How does  a Manual Choke work?</span><br/>
                If you   spend enough time around older classic vehicles you will surely be familiar with   the manual choke system. They consist of a knob and cable for the driver to be   able to open and close the choke plate. These certainly have their place in   trucks, farm equipment, lawn mowers and in some passenger cars. We do not like   to see them used unless they were original to the vehicle. There are people that   just prefer to be in CONTROL of the choke system and will install a manual choke   for that reason alone. Manual choke conversions are really not a good option   because of the unavailability of parts that are reliable enough to stay working.   We very seldom do these types of conversions for that reason, except on high performance applications.<br/>
<img height="10" src="images/bullet%20clear.png" width="10"/><br/>
<span class="style4R"><a id="9" name="9"></a>9) How does  an Electric Choke work?</span><br/>
              Electric   choke assemblies differ from hot air chokes by the fact that the heat comes from   the cap itself. Inside the black choke cap is a heating element, much like the   heating element on your electric stove. It gets red hot and provides heat to the   bi-metal spring to make the choke plate open. We do not prefer electric chokes   because they go from closed to fully open in about 45 seconds. As stated   earlier, it takes an engine 5-7 minutes to reach operating temperature, and in   less than a minute the engine is not ready for such lean air/fuel mixtures that   are going to be introduced into the engine. This causes driveability issues which   include hesitations, flat spots, surging and dying. Anytime our clients will   listen to us we try to discourage the use of electric chokes. The Ford electric   choke caps that were first introduced in 1973 are unique. First, they operate on   7 volts, as opposed to the usual 12 volts. The 7 volts comes off a special   terminal on a Ford alternator. In addition, they have ambient air temperature   sensors built in and will not work below 60 degrees. Anyone who tries to use the   original Ford electric caps alone will find they are pretty much useless. All of   the Ford Motor Company vehicles 1973 and newer not only had the electric assist   choke cap, but also had the hot air tubes running through the exhaust manifold.   The idea was that the electric assist would open the choke cap at warm ambient   temperatures when the engine didn't’t need much help (fully open in about 45   seconds). It was used mainly as an emission device, not a totally electric   choke.            <img height="10" src="images/bullet%20clear.png" width="10"/><br/>

<a id="10" name="10"></a><span class="style4R">10) What is the   difference between the 65-67 and the '68-69 Autolite   1100 carbs?</span><br/>
              68-69 Autolite 1100-1V carburetors differ from the 65-67 carbs in 2 ways. First, they do not have a <a href="Loadomatic.html">Spark Control Valve</a> (looks like a power valve). For the engine to function   properly with this carb, the distributor must have centrifugal advance (spring   loaded weights inside) along with the vacuum advance unit. However the '67 and older carbs   (except '66 and '67 California Emissions) utilized the <a href="Loadomatic.html">Load-O-matic</a> distributor,   which had vacuum advance only. The second difference is the CFM. In 1968 Ford   put a 170 CID size carburetor on a 200 CID engine. If you ever looked at the   engine specs, in 1968 the 200 CID engine is rated at 115 HP (this was generous, it is   probably more like 105 HP). The 1967 and older engines were rated 120 HP. By   changing the venturi inside the 1968 carb to the larger 1967 and older size, we   can substantially increase your performance. The difference in the standing   quarter mile is about 6 MPH. The cost for this upgrade is $30. <br/>

<span class="style4R"><a id="11" name="11"></a>11) What is Annular Fuel Discharge?</span><br/>
               Many  enthusiast consider the Autolite 2100 (2V) and 4100 (4V)  carbs to be
            the best  carb  ever built.  The engineering involved in their design was tremendous, and they were offered in several  sizes so they could be used in unlimited applications. Unfortunately this feature was never incorporated into the Autolite 1100 (1V) series carb. <br/>
<br/>
            NOTE: 
            One company redesigned the 1100-1V  carb, which incorporated  annular discharge nozzles, however they were plagued with quality control issues (leaky carb bodies, faulty floats, etc). While these carbs were  produced  for a couple years,  they are no longer in production, as far as I know (long story). <br/>
<br/>
            Annular Fuel Discharge   carburetors  produce greatly enhanced torque in the lower  RPM range,   more peak horsepower and torque, as well as better   combustion and fuel burn through-out the entire RPM range. This results in superior fuel economy, improved throttle response, and    it enhances overall performance. This is state of the art technology was  patented by Ford Motor Company in 1957. As such, Autolite carburetors  were the only carbs produced using this unique technique of   metering, distributing, and mixing the fuel into the air stream for the next fifty years. <br/>
<br/>
Down-leg boosters, found in most other carbs of this time period, utilize a single orifice to discharge  fuel. Annular boosters, on the other hand, employ a series of several smaller  orifices, which  instantly change the fuel from it's   liquid  state to a  gas vapor. And as you probably   already know,  it’s vapor that burns, not liquid.
            At lower engine speeds, slow air speeds   in the venturi's create a weak signal, which reduces the amount of fuel moving through the   boosters. However   annular discharge boosters  offer multiple points for the   fuel to enter the venturi, as opposed to a single discharge point. This yields measurable advantages, especially when    large-volume carburetors are used in conjunction with a long duration camshafts. Annular-discharge boosters can   greatly improve throttle response and driveability, even when a weak manifold-vacuum signal is present at idle, partial   throttle, or under sudden acceleration.<br/>

<p align="justify" class="style3B"><span class="style4R"><a id="13" name="13"></a>13) Why am I having problems adjusting my new carburetor?</span><br/>
              The number one problem in   the industry concerning engine driveability is ignition timing.  Most of the problems that you are experiencing are probably   due to late timing, simply because the factory timing specs are just too   retarded to get anything done. However, the engine really wakes up when you advance the   timing properly. Most people use timing lights to set their timing, but  timing lights may not be reliable. The reason for this is very simple. The timing marks are located on the harmonic balancer, which is mounted in rubber, and over the years they MOVE, when the rubber dries out.  This is why we recommend replacing your harmonic balancer whenever you rebuild a motor (see our tech article on <a href="Balancer.html">Harmonic Balancers</a>). <br/>
<img height="10" src="images/bullet%20clear.png" width="10"/><br/>
              Whenever customers call   us concerning driveability problems (hesitation, flat spots, surges) 99% of the   time, the problem is ignition timing. We will share with you an accumulation of   many years of experience and if you follow our GOOF PROOF method -you will be   rewarded with the best driveability and performance you have ever experienced. <br/>
<img height="10" src="images/bullet%20clear.png" width="10"/><br/>
              All Ford engines run   better, deliver more power, and give better fuel economy with the timing advanced   BEYOND factory specifications. We should also note that premium unleaded fuel is highly recommended, especially   in six cylinder engines. After you have adjusted your timing properly,  the engine should    not quite "ping" on full   acceleration, or under load. If the motor PINGS, it's an indication that the timing is advanced too far. Do not leave it like this.... PINGING, or pre-ignition, can and will severely damage the engine in a very short time (minutes). <br/>
<img height="10" src="images/bullet%20clear.png" width="10"/><br/>
              For your engine to run properly the carburetor must be sized properly.  There are several carbs that will work on the small six, including Autolite carbs, but not limited to them.   Autolite offered  eight different sizes in the 2100-2V series, as well as the 1100-1V, which  was offered in three different  cfm ratings. <br/>
