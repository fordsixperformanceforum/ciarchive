<tr>
<td bgcolor="#FFFFFF" colspan="2" height="489" width="100%"><p align="justify"><span class="style3B">The following policies apply to  orders shipped within the Continental United States. For all orders outside the USA, please read our <a href="ShipNational.html"><strong>International Shipping</strong></a> policies.</span></p>
<p align="justify"><span class="style3B">All freight charges are the responsibility of the   consumer and must be paid in full prior to shipment. When ordering through the   web site shopping cart, the shipping charges are automatically calculated and   included in the total order amount. All   orders are normally shipped via UPS, however Classic Inlines reserves the right to ship   packages via USPS or FedEx at our sole discretion</span>. </p>
<p align="justify" class="style3B">Light weight packages and letters will normally be shipped via USPS Priority mail so that we may provide the fastest possible service to our customers. USPS Priority shipments generally arrive in two or   three days,  under normal circumstances, which is commonly faster than UPS Common Ground.   USPS also delivers on Saturday, whereas UPS does not, which may result in a   package arriving on the weekend when you really need it, rather than on Monday.   Therefore we feel we are attempting to provide  faster and better service to our customers,   under normal circumstances, by choosing this method of shipment over UPS or FedEx. When Classic Inlines chooses to use USPS rather than UPS, resulting in additional shipping charges, Classic Inlines will absorb any additional cost. </p>
<p align="justify" class="style3B">As long as a package is shipped within the continental USA, Classic Inlines will do   every- thing  possible to honor the amount quoted by the online calculator at the   time the 
              order was placed. However, in some rare cases the shipment of an order   or certain 
              items, 
              may exceed the amount quoted. In such cases, Classic Inlines will notify   the customer by e-mail  prior to shipping the order. If the shipping cost are unacceptable by the customer, and/or Classic Inlines is unwilling to absorb the additional charges, the   
              order will be canceled 
              and all monies paid will be refunded. </p>
<p align="justify" class="style3B">Once an order has been shipped, Classic Inlines will provide the   tracking number for all UPS, and USPS Priority shipments, upon request. In the near   future, you will also be able to access the tracking number, and/or check the status   of your order online, by simply logging on the web site   with your own personalized user account number, or the order number. </p>
<p align="justify" class="style3B">Title of merchandise passes to the buyer upon delivery to the common carrier   (UPS or USPS) and delivery of all merchandise is the responsibility of the   common carrier. Claims for damages, lost, or short shipments, must be made by the   customer directly to the carrier with notification of the claim and the claim   number provided to Classic Inlines for support in resolving such   claims. Classic Inlines will not be held responsible or liable for   freight damaged merchandise, delays, or lost packages. Classic Inlines now offers our customers an  option in which the customer can purchase shipping   insurance, if they so desire. Shipping insurance is quoted during the check out process and is the sole responsibility of our customer. If the customer chooses not to purchase shipping insurance, the package will be shipped without insurance, and all claims will be  the sole responsibility of the customer. </p>
<p align="justify" class="style3B">Classic Inlines is not liable for any delays in shipping, for any reason whatsoever.   Occasionally, we are unable to ship an order in a timely fashion, for various reasons. We may be out of town   attending a shows or convention, out with an illness, on a   personal vacation, or simply unavailable for other personal reasons. Please remember, we are a sole proprietor company, meaning there is only one person to pull, pack, and ship  the orders. Unlike  Summit, Jegs, and many other large companies, which employee several employees for these task. Therefore, even though it is a rare occurrence, please allow up to
              10 days  for common ground or parcel post shipments. </p>
<p align="justify" class="style3B">All 3 Day Select orders will take precedence over Common Ground shipments, and we will do everything possible to ship  3 Day Select orders within a 24 hour time period. However 
              if 
              a shipment, whether 3 Day Select or Common Ground, is delayed beyond a reasonable amount of time, Classic Inlines  reserves the right to cancel the order. In such cases Classic Inlines will notify the customer via e-mail or by phone, and reserves the right to  refund the   purchase amount, or ship the order at the earliest possible date.  If the customer paid for 3 Day Select, and   the shipment is delayed beyond 24 hours, Classic Inlines will refund the difference in the shipping cost (3 Day   verses common ground) and reserves the right to ship the order via  3 Day Select or Common Ground, at our sole discretion. </p>
<p align="justify" class="style3B">We apologize for any delays that may occur, but   occasionally they are necessary and may be beyond our control. However, please   understand that we will do everything we can to ship your order as quickly and   efficiently as possible. After all, we want you to come back the next time you need   a quality part and your repeated business is essential to our success. Thank   you. <br/>
<br/>
            For all orders outside the USA, please read our <a href="ShipNational.html"><strong>International Shipping</strong></a> policies.</p>
