<td colspan="2" height="489" width="100%"><p align="justify">There has always been a huge debate over which is better, hooking the distributor to ported vacuum, or to manifold vacuum. Some say ported vacuum must be use, while others say you should  use manifold vacuum (such as the author of the article below). We recommend using which-ever works best for your application. If the motor runs better on ported, great, but if it runs better on manifold vacuum, that's fine too. There is no right or wrong answer. Try both and see which one your motor likes best. In general terms, ported vacuum results in lower emissions, while manifold vacuum  results in lower engine temps, especially at idle.  Most engines will idle a little higher on manifold vacuum, however this can be corrected by adjusting the idle speed on the carb.<br/>
<br/>
            This article discusses vacuum advance, using a conventional distributor with mechanical (centrifugal weights) vacuum advance. While the theory still applies to the " Load-O-Matic" distributors, since they use manifold vacuum to sense load, keep in mind  the  "Load-O-Matic" distributors did not use centrifugal weights to compensate for changes in rpm. Instead they used "Venturi Vacuum" and a "Spark Control Valve", which were incorporated into the "Autolite 1100" carburetors. For more information, please see our tech article on <a href="Loadomatic.html">"Load-O-Matic"</a> distributors.</p>

              Anyone driving a street-driven car   without manifold-connected vacuum advance is sacrificing idle cooling, throttle   response, engine efficiency, and fuel economy, probably because they don't   understand what vacuum advance is, how it works, and what it's for - there are   lots of long-time experienced "mechanics" who don't understand the principles   and operation of vacuum advance either, so they're not alone. <br/>
<br/>
              The most important concept to understand is that lean   mixtures, such as at idle and steady highway cruise, take longer to burn than   rich mixtures; idle in particular, as idle mixture is affected by exhaust gas   dilution. This requires that lean mixtures have "the fire lit" earlier in the   compression cycle (spark timing advanced), allowing more burn time so that peak   cylinder pressure is reached just after TDC for peak efficiency and reduced   exhaust gas temperature (wasted combustion energy). Rich mixtures, on the other   hand, burn faster than lean mixtures, so they need to have "the fire lit" later   in the compression cycle (spark timing retarded slightly) so maximum cylinder   pressure is still achieved at the same point after TDC as with the lean mixture,   for maximum efficiency.<br/>
<br/>
              The centrifugal advance system in a distributor   advances spark timing purely as a function of engine rpm (irrespective of engine   load or operating conditions), with the amount of advance and the rate at which   it comes in determined by the weights and springs on top of the autocam   mechanism. The amount of advance added by the distributor, combined with initial   static timing, is "total timing" (i.e., the 34-36 degrees at high rpm that most   SBC's like). Vacuum advance has absolutely nothing to do with total timing or   performance, as when the throttle is opened, manifold vacuum drops essentially   to zero, and the vacuum advance drops out entirely; it has no part in the "total   timing" equation.<br/>
<br/>
              At idle, the engine needs additional spark advance in   order to fire that lean, diluted mixture earlier in order to develop maximum   cylinder pressure at the proper point, so the vacuum advance can (connected to   manifold vacuum, not "ported" vacuum - more on that aberration later) is   activated by the high manifold vacuum, and adds about 15 degrees of spark   advance, on top of the initial static timing setting (i.e., if your static   timing is at 10 degrees, at idle it's actually around 25 degrees with the vacuum   advance connected). The same thing occurs at steady-state highway cruise; the   mixture is lean, takes longer to burn, the load on the engine is low, the   manifold vacuum is high, so the vacuum advance is again deployed, and if you had   a timing light set up so you could see the balancer as you were going down the   highway, you'd see about 50 degrees advance (10 degrees initial, 20-25 degrees   from the centrifugal advance, and 15 degrees from the vacuum advance) at   steady-state cruise (it only takes about 40 horsepower to cruise at   50mph).<br/>
<br/>
              When you accelerate, the mixture is instantly enriched (by the   accelerator pump, power valve, etc.), burns faster, doesn't need the additional   spark advance, and when the throttle plates open, manifold vacuum drops, and the   vacuum advance can returns to zero, retarding the spark timing back to what is   provided by the initial static timing plus the centrifugal advance provided by   the distributor at that engine rpm; the vacuum advance doesn't come back into   play until you back off the gas and manifold vacuum increases again as you   return to steady-state cruise, when the mixture again becomes lean.<br/>
<br/>
              The   key difference is that centrifugal advance (in the distributor autocam via   weights and springs) is purely rpm-sensitive; nothing changes it except changes   in rpm. Vacuum advance, on the other hand, responds to engine load and   rapidly-changing operating conditions, providing the correct degree of spark   advance at any point in time based on engine load, to deal with both lean and   rich mixture conditions. By today's terms, this was a relatively crude   mechanical system, but it did a good job of optimizing engine efficiency,   throttle response, fuel economy, and idle cooling, with absolutely ZERO effect   on wide-open throttle performance, as vacuum advance is inoperative under   wide-open throttle conditions. In modern cars with computerized engine   controllers, all those sensors and the controller change both mixture and spark   timing 50 to 100 times per second, and we don't even HAVE a distributor any more   - it's all electronic.<br/>
<br/>
              Now, to the widely-misunderstood   manifold-vs.-ported vacuum aberration. After 30-40 years of controlling vacuum   advance with full manifold vacuum, along came emissions requirements, years   before catalytic converter technology had been developed, and all manner of   crude band-aid systems were developed to try and reduce hydrocarbons and oxides   of nitrogen in the exhaust stream. One of these band-aids was "ported spark",   which moved the vacuum pickup orifice in the carburetor body, from below the   throttle plate where it was exposed to full manifold vacuum at idle, to above   the throttle plate where it saw no manifold vacuum at all at idle. This meant   the vacuum advance was in-operative at idle (retarding spark timing from its   optimum value), and these applications also had VERY low initial static timing   (usually 4 degrees or less, and some actually were set at 2 degrees AFTER TDC).   This was done in order to increase exhaust gas temperature (due to "lighting the   fire late") to improve the effectiveness of the "after burning" of hydrocarbons   by the air injected into the exhaust manifolds by the A.I.R. system; as a   result, these engines ran like crap, and an enormous amount of wasted heat   energy was transferred through the exhaust port walls into the coolant, causing   them to run hot at idle - cylinder pressure fell off, engine temperatures went   up, combustion efficiency went down the drain, and fuel economy went down with   it.<br/>
<br/>
              If you look at the centrifugal advance calibrations for these "ported   spark, late-timed" engines, you'll see that instead of having 20 degrees of   advance, they had up to 34 degrees of advance in the distributor, in order to   get back to the 34-36 degrees "total timing" at high rpm wide-open throttle to   get some of the performance back. The vacuum advance still worked at   steady-state highway cruise (lean mixture = low emissions), but it was   inoperative at idle, which caused all manner of problems - "ported vacuum" was   strictly an early, crude emissions strategy, and nothing   more.<br/>
<br/>
              Vacuum   advance calibrations are different between stock engines and modified engines,   especially if you have a lot of cam and have relatively low manifold vacuum at   idle. Most stock vacuum advance cans are not fully-deployed until they see about   15” of manifold vacuum, so those cans don’t work very well on a modified   engines with less than 15" of vacuum. At idle, the stock can may “dither” in   and out, in response to the rapidly-changing manifold vacuum, constantly varying   the amount of vacuum advance, which creates an unstable idle. Modified engines   with more cam, that generate less than 15”  of manifold vacuum at idle, may benefit from a vacuum   advance can that’s fully-deployed at least 1” below the actual manifold vacuum reading. For example, the Echlin #VC-1810   vacuum advance can (about $10 at NAPA) provides the same amount of advance as a stock   can, but it is fully-deployed at  8” of vacuum, so there is no   variation in idle timing even with a stout cam. You can also purchase adjustable vacuum advance cams, which do the same thing. However, the stock vacuum can should suffice for most applications. <br/>
<br/>
              For peak engine   performance, driveability, idle cooling and efficiency in a street-driven car,   you need vacuum advance, connected to full manifold vacuum.
