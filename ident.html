<td bgcolor="#FFFFFF" colspan="2"><p align="justify"> <a id="top" name="top"></a>Ever wonder what size motor  you have? If so, your not the only one. To the inexperienced enthusiast all small sixes look identical, however there are minor differences which can be easily spotted if you know what to look for.   In this article we'll cover  a majority of the differences, for engines  produced in the USA, even though  you only need to know three  to identify the engine size (see <a href="#sum">Summary</a>). <br/>
<br/>
             While Australian and/or Argentina built motors are similar to their US counterparts, they have their own unique set of differences. Some of these differences are the same  as their US counterparts, while many  are not. For example, all US-250ci engines had a low mount starter, while the Australian and Argentina 250's had   a high mount starter. Therefore exhaust headers produced for an Australian 250ci will not fit the
             US-250ci, or vice versa. Another example would be the oil pump, while the oil pump drive is the same size, the bolt patterns are different. Therefore  the oil pumps are not interchangeable. The US-200/250ci distributors and cylinder heads will fit an Australian 200/221/250ci Pre-Crossflow, and vice versa. However the AU-250ci Crossflow distributors and cylinder heads are unique to the Crossflow  and will not interchange with the US-200/250ci engines. One last example is  the oil pan,  also non-interchangeable, as the   Australian and Argentina 250ci oil pans (and blocks) are one inch narrower in width. The list goes on..... </p>

<p align="justify"><span class="style4B">General Description:</span> The Small Six (or Falcon Six), overhead valve,  inline 6-cylinder engine was introduced in 1960 with a cast iron block and cylinder head. All US cylinder heads incorporated an integral one barrel intake manifold, more commonly known as a log intake. The crankshaft and flywheel are dynamically balanced, and the crankshafts are  fitted with a harmonic damper, which is often  called a balancer. </p>

<p align="justify">Below is an example of the tags used on    engines from 64 on. This is the tag from a 1969 250ci engine. They are quite similar to those  found on  carbs, rear ends    and transmissions. They are usually quite accurate, and were normally installed on one of the coil bracket bolts. Unfortunately they are commonly lost or left off after  a  rebuild.</p>

</table>
<p align="justify"><span class="style4B">              Main Bearings:</span> All  144/170ci, and 200ci blocks prior to mid '64, had four main bearings. 
            While the 200ci from mid '64 onwards, and all 250ci blocks, had  seven mains bearings. </p>
<p align="justify"><span class="style4B">Rods: </span>All 144/170/200/250ci engines have forged H section connection rods, with the exception those built in 78-79, which used  either  cast iron, cast steel, or nodular iron. </p>
<p align="justify"><span class="style4B">Stroke:</span> The 144ci engine has a 2.50 inch stroke, while the 170ci has a 2.94 inch 
            stroke. The 200 has a 3.13 inch stroke, while the 250ci engine has a 3.91 inch stroke. </p>
<p align="justify"><span class="style4B">Pistons:</span> All 144/170ci engines have cast aluminum   flat top pistons with a 3.50" diameter, while the 200/250ci engines utilized a dished piston with a 3.68" diameter. The dish size was normally 6.5 cc's, however a 13 cc dish was used in California engines, which lowered the compression ratio and reduced  emissions. </p>
<p align="justify"><span class="style4B">Cylinder Bore: </span>All 144/170ci engines have a 3.50 inch cylinder bore, while the 200/250ci have 3.68 inch cylinder bore. <br/>
<br/>
<span class="style4B">Cylinder Heads: </span>Depending on the production year, the chamber size, valve size,  intake size (manifold volume), and carburetion varied considerably. Carb bores were as follows: 144/170ci: 1.325", early 200ci:  1.500", later 200/250ci: 1.75" (all were 1V carbs). </p>
<p align="justify"><span class="style4B">Lifters:</span> '60-'62 <strong class="style3B">144</strong>/170ci engines had solid lifters, '63-'65 144/170ci engines had both styles depending on the year and model, while  '66-UP 144/170ci engines  had hydraulic lifters. All 200/250ci engines had hydraulic lifters. <strong>Example:</strong> The  '64 Falcon 170ci had hydraulic lifters, while the '64 Ranchero 170ci had solid lifters. <br/>
<br/>
<span class="style4B">Rockers:</span> '60-'62 <strong class="style3B">144</strong>/170ci engines had adjustable rockers, '63-'65 144/170ci engines had both adjustable and non-adjustable rockers, depending on the year and model, while the '66-UP 144/170ci engines  had non-adjustable rockers. All 200/250ci engines had non-adjustable rockers. <strong>Example:</strong> a '64 Falcon 170ci with hydraulic lifters had non-adjustable, while the '64 Ranchero 170ci with solid lifters had adjustable.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="style4B">Distributors: </span>All 144ci engines, and 1960-mid'64 170ci engines, had a 1/4" hex drive-shaft. The mid'64-UP 170ci engines, as well as all  200/250ci engine,s  had a 5/16"   hex drive-shaft. 
                <strong>Note:</strong> This is only a rule of thumb, as it may vary depending on the year and model type. <br/>
<br/>
<span class="style4B">Starters:</span> Most 144/170/200ci engines had high mount  starters, which were mounted above the  oil pan rim, while the 250ci engines had low mount starters, which were  mounted below the oil pan rim. However some 200ci engines,  used in Econoline vans and trucks  (1980-83), had  custom bell housings (similar to a SBF bell) which utilized  a  low mount starter. <br/>
<br/>
<span class="style4B">Freeze Plugs:</span> The <strong class="style3B">144</strong>/170ci engines have   3 water jacket freeze plugs which are visible directly below the exhaust   manifold, while the 200/250ci engine have 5 freeze plugs. <br/>
<span class="style3Bl">This is the easiest way to distinguish the 144/170ci from the 200/250ci engines. </span></p>
<p align="justify"><span class="style4B">Water Pumps:</span> All 144/170/200ci engines used a 3 bolt water pump, while the 250ci six utilized a 4 bolt water pump. <span class="style3Bl">This is the easiest way to distinguish a 250ci from the 144/170/200ci  six. </span></p>
<p align="justify"><span class="style4B">Color Schemes</span>: The 144ci has a blue valve cover and air cleaner, and black block. The 170/200ci engines had an orange valve cover and air cleaner, and a black block prior to 1965. From 1965 onwards the 170/200ci engines had  a Ford blue valve cover, air cleaner, and  block. Some early 170/200ci motors had an orange oil pan as well. The 250ci engine came with a Ford blue valve cover, air cleaner, and  block. However, these color combos were not set in stone, as they did change on some  models, and/or specials. Hence this is only a general guideline. <a id="sum" name="sum"></a></p>

</table>
<p align="justify"><span class="style4B">Summary</span>: Here's how to figure  out what size the block is. Identification can be made with a quick glance at three items on the motor, the water pump, number of freeze plugs, and the block code (<span class="style3B">found on the road  draft tube mounting boss)</span>. The only trick is determining the difference between a 170ci 4 main and a 200ci 4 main, if there is no block code, as both engines had a three bolt water pump and three freeze plugs. The only way I know of for sure, is to verify the bore size. If I learn of another method, I'll let you know. </p>
