<td colspan="2" height="489" width="100%"><p align="justify" class="style3B">When Ford introduced the Mustang in April of 1964, the base powerplant  was the Falcon's 170ci six with 101 horsepower and 156 lb-ft of torque. Later  that year, in August, Ford updated the Mustang's engine line-up with the seven  main bearing 200ci six as standard equipment. Both the 170 and 200ci sixes are  well known and respected for rugged dependability. But engineering shortcomings  have plagued them since the beginning. The greatest shortcoming is a lackluster  induction system, which is positioned directly over a hot exhaust manifold. The  Mustang six's ignition system was the old-school Ford/Holley Load-O-Matic  distributor, which also offered disappointing performance. </p>
<p align="justify" class="style3B"><strong class="style5BK"><u>Six Faults &amp; Fixes</u></strong><br/>
<br/>
              Autolite's 1100 series one-barrel carburetor  entered service in 1963 to replace the Holley 1900 series glass bowl  carburetor. It was a Mustang six mainstay until '69. There were three 1100  venturi sizes: 1.00-, 1.10-, and 1.20-inches depending upon model year and  application. From '63-'67, the 1100 employed a spark control valve for use with  the Load-O-Matic distributor, which had vacuum advance but no mechanical  advance. The absence of a mechanical advance hindered performance. 
              Although the spark control 1100 carburetor and  Load-O-Matic distributor may seem unconventional in function, they're quite  simple. The spark control valve gets its vacuum signal from two places in the  carburetor throat. One is at the throat of the venturi while the other is in  the bore just above the throttle plate. The spark control valve is calibrated  to function at specific vacuum pressures (working against spring pressure)  depending upon throttle position. At steady throttle, the spark control valve  is held open by vacuum against spring pressure. What the spark control valve  does next depends on engine speed, throttle position, and load. During  acceleration, the vacuum signal is low enough that the spark control valve's  spring pressure closes the valve and vacuum to the advance unit is cut off. Yet  some vacuum at the venturi throat keeps the advance from going full spark  retard. <br/>
<br/>
            As engine rpm catches up with throttle position, the manifold's vacuum  signal acts on the spark control valve diaphragm, which opens the valve to  provide a strong vacuum signal to the vacuum advance. When engine speed  increases with the throttle open, manifold vacuum decreases and the spark  control valve closes, preventing venturi vacuum loss due to bleed back caused  by manifold vacuum at the throttle plate. This gives full spark advance at high  engine speeds. By the same token, the spark control valve also has to retard  spark when throttle position and load are such that too much timing could cause  engine damage due to spark knock. The spark control valve has the job of spark  advance and retard depending upon load and throttle position. What makes the  spark control valve different than a Holley/Autolite power valve is vent holes.  You will see them in the spark control valve, but not a power valve. These holes  allow atmospheric pressure to act on the diaphragm while manifold vacuum acts  on the inside to modulate the valve.</p>
<h3 align="justify" class="style4B"><u class="style5BK">Dual Advance</u><br/>
<br/>
<span class="style3B">Beginning with the '68 model year, Ford switched  its inline sixes to a dual-advance/retard distributor with both a vacuum and  mechanical advance like V-8s of the period. Instead of a spark control valve,  the Autolite 1100 carburetor provided a throttled vacuum signal instead of a  valve-controlled vacuum signal. As a result of tougher emission standards, the  dual-advance feature was also advance/retard, with spark advance during  acceleration and retard during deceleration to reduce exhaust emissions. <br/>
<br/>
              The reason we've shown you both types of fuel  and ignition systems is to show you what happens when you don't have a proper  match. We've seen our share of mismatched carburetors and ignition systems,  which cause serious drivability problems. If you run an Autolite 1100  carburetor with a spark control valve and a dual advance distributor, you won't  get sufficient vacuum to operate the vacuum advance. If you run an 1100  carburetor without a spark control valve with a Load-O-Matic distributor, you  will wind up with too much spark advance. If you're having drivability issues  with your Mustang six, the first thing you need to check is carburetor and  ignition for compatibility. During a recent visit to The Restomod Shop in  Stockton, California, we witnessed a pristine '66 Mustang hardtop with 200ci  six that wouldn't idle properly. It didn't take long to figure out why. It had  the Load-O-Matic distributor with an 1100 carburetor void of the spark control  valve. At idle, the vacuum signal was strong, causing excessive spark advance  and making it impossible for this engine to idle properly. It needed the 1100  carburetor with spark control valve. <br/>
<br/>
              Terry Simpson of The Restomod Shop donned his  troubleshooting skills and went to work on this Mustang with the installation  of the correct 1100 carburetor with spark control valve. The more Terry  examined this engine, the more troubling issues he found. You need to do the  same in your driveway as a means to honing your own technical skills. Does the  vacuum advance operate? Check this by connecting and disconnecting the vacuum  line with engine at a fast idle. If rpm drops when you disconnect, you have a  working vacuum advance. One cylinder at a time, disconnect each ignition wire  at the distributor cap. Does rpm drop or remain the same? If speed doesn't  change, you have a weak or dead cylinder. Spray carburetor cleaner around  potential vacuum leak areas like the carburetor base plate and spacer. Does the  engine surge? If so, you've found a vacuum leak. Pull the PCV valve and check  for vacuum. At idle, you should feel suction and the engine should surge. <br/>
<br/>
            Is there valvetrain noise, meaning a clicking  rocker arm or dry valve spring? If you can hear valvetrain operation with  hydraulic lifters, something is wrong, mandating a visual inspection. There  should be plenty of oil flow throughout the rocker arm assembly. Return flow  should also be good. While you are tuning, check things like coolant flow  through the radiator at operating temperature with the thermostat open. Examine  the engine for oil and coolant leaks. Replace fuel hoses at every tune-up and  use high-pressure fuel injection hose throughout, which is resistant to today's  harsh fuel additives.</span></h3>
<p align="justify"><span class="style5BK"><u>Don't Forget the Details</u></span><br/>
<br/>
<span class="style3B">Sometimes, we get so caught up in the confusion of engine  troubleshooting that we miss important details. We swap carburetors, change  ignition points, adjust timing--yet fail to notice the obvious. What about  proper choke adjustment when the engine is cold, with a steady pull-off as the  engine warms? Is there a healthy accelerator pump shot when you work the  throttle? Is PCV valve function what it should be? If you have ignition points,  is the gap correct? Are contacts pitted? Does your Mustang have the correct  ignition coil? Have you examined the distributor cap and rotor for cracks and  proper continuity? Do your ignition wires pass the resistance test? Is your  fuel pump long in the tooth and not delivering adequate pressure and volume?  What about the fuel filter? Even if it seems irrelevant, check it. <br/>
<br/>
            Though the nimble Ford six presents its share of tuning and  performance challenges, it doesn't have to be a poor performer. If you believe  in this engine, there's plenty you can do to get its performance back on the  beam. Your greatest friend in engine tuning is the desire to troubleshoot.  There are no freak occurrences nor is there magic, just physical facts. If you  cover the bases step by step and pay close attention to detail, you can  super-tune your Mustang six and wind up with a reliable powerplant that will  give you a lot of driving pleasure for years to come. </span></p>
