<span class="style3">In memory of Travis Allen Smith   </span><br/>
  Travis was killed instantly, at age 17, in a car accident just south of Moab, Utah.<br/> 
  A man transporting illegal 
  
  aliens fell asleep at the wheel after driving all night,  
  <br/>
  crossing 
  the centerline and hitting Travis's Mustang head on at a  high rate of speed. <br/>
  The driver of the other car survived, as did the three males in the rear seat. However,<br/> 
  a young female in the front passenger seat was also killed. Travis was an active member <br/>
  of the FordSix Performance forum, had a passion for Mustangs and inline sixes, <br/>
  and will be forever missed by all that knew him. Rest in peace my friend. </td>
