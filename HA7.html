<td height="110"><p align="justify" class="style3B">Our final rating showed an additional 10 horsepower. The added carburetion was   letting the engine really come on in the higher rpm bracket, and we were belting   out a solid 115 rear wheel hp up at 4800 rpm. Translated into a 0-60 time, this   amounted to a 9.4-second clocking (or close to a second off our previous time at   the end of last months alterations). A trip down the quarter-mile netted 81 mph   in the low 16-second bracket. One further benefit here; the gas mileage was   beginning to show decline, but not as much as one might suspect as the car was   still capable of consistent 18 to 2O mpg at normal cruising speeds.<br/>
<br/>
                  With   the carburetion and cam changes, the engine still had a more-than-reasonable   idle at a steady 600 rpm, leading me to believe this setup could be used very   nicely with the little C-4 automatic transmission.<br/>
<br/>
                  When we had put on an   additional 1000 miles or so with this setup, the urge to go to the four Honda   Keihin carburetors became too strong. Having previously brazed the four flanges   onto the manifold, the transition was only a matter of two or three hours work.   When installing the Honda carburetors, we noticed they did not care too much for   high pulsating fuel pressure (due to their small float assemblies), so a   regulator was installed to limit fuel pressure to 3 pounds. This did the job   very nicely. The first run-up on the dyno indicated lean mixture conditions in   the medium rpm range. This was cured by removing the .028mm jets and replacing   them with .042's. The main jets were subsequently enlarged to .070, and a set of   adjustable needles were installed. These are available from Honda agencies. The   metering rods have five notches for adjustments, and we found the "number two"   notch (from the top) to be the ideal setup.<br/>
<br/>
                  These changes seemed to bring   the air-to-fuel ratio into balance, so we decided to give the little six a full   blast on the dyno and see what we could get in the way of additional horsepower.   I was also very interested to find out what the small carburetors would do for   horsepower in the lower rpm ranges, so we took a reading at 2800 rpm and netted   75 hp at the rear wheels. At 3800 rpm we had l05 hp, and we reached the top of   the ladder at 4800 rpm, with 125 hp. This proved to us that our idea on the   soundness of this type carburetion was right. When you jump on the throttle with   the little bears, it is just like having fuel injection. It feels like all the   horsepower unloads at once. <br/>
<br/>
                  In driving the car on the road, we found we could   still stabilize the idle, very nicely at around 600 rpm. As a matter of fact,   the idling adjustment on these Keihin carbs proved to be something to behold.   This setup came with a smoother idle than 99 percent of all the stock cars I   have ever played with. We did, however, encounter flat spots in the extreme low   end of the rpm range, but, after all, when playing around with 5.8 square inches   of carburetion on such a small engine, one must learn to expect that all cannot   be "peaches and cream." To offset the flat--spot disadvantage, the price of   these units is only $25.00 each.<br/>
<br/>
                  Exploring still further the possibility of   using side-draft carburetion, we decided to check a couple of the Tillotson   diaphragms used on the American Harley-Davidson motorcycles. This is a very   simple, straightforward carburetor of 1 5/8-inch venturi dimensions. Testing   proved this arrangement to be capable of equaling the SU's in all-out   horsepower, but having more flat spots than a thief would encounter in robbing a   banana factory.<br/>
<br/>
                  The general behavior of the car in normal stop, go, and   cruising ranges was a most pleasant surprise. Later tests proved this car to be   capable of 84 to 85 mph in the quarter-mile. With 4:1 gearing and 27-inch   rubber, 5500 rpm could be had at any time, and this is 110 mph. This performance   proved more than equal to several versions of the 289 2-V and 4-V jobs that we   found willing to try us on for size.<br/>
<br/>
                  We also tried the 4:1 gearing in   conjunction with the four-speed tranny, and our conclusions would be to forget   this setup since it wreaks havoc with gas mileage and is certainly not conducive   to good smooth road speeds at 70 mph. Instead, stay with the three--speed   synchro with the 3.20 rear gear set. As for the remainder of the work, take your   pick. It all proved very exciting and rewarding for us since we have always felt   that true hot rodding is venturing into the unknown or unusual.<br/>
<br/>
                  I have   personally gained a tremendous respect for the latest version of the seven-main,   six-cylinder engine and sometimes wish one could purchase such a Package, call   it a GT Six, and add some minor heavy-duty equipment to the chassis. This   combination would give a good accounting of itself when compared to many foreign   sporty Jobs that cost considerably more.<br/>
<br/>
                  So as we close our hood and roar   off into the setting sun. We can only say come on and join the six-cylinder   parade for more fun with less money than you ever could imagine!</p>
