<td width="349"><p align="justify" class="style4R"><strong>Measuring Horsepower<br/>
<br/>
<span class="style3B">In the beginning I drove the car 2000 miles to stabilize the   engine which, by the way, came with the full California Thermactor smog   equipment. After bringing the engine right up to factory specifications. I look   a run on my electric chassis dynamometer and recorded 65 horsepower at the rear   wheels. Weighed against the 120 advertised horsepower, this sounds as if some   guy at the factory forgot to give us a full load, But such was not the case, and   I would like to digress here for a moment to explain a few pertinent facts about   horsepower measurement. There are three basic means of ascertaining   horsepower gains. One,<br/>
                                of course, would be to remove the engine and run a full   series of tests on a regular engine dynamometer stand.</span></strong></p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td colspan="2" height="238"><p align="justify"><span class="style3B">However, sometimes these   figures cannot be correlated to the installed horsepower by the individual who   reads the data, due to the fact that the installed horsepower is naturally   somewhat less (because of exhaust inefficiencies. under hood breathing. and drag   due to accessories). Another method is the practical one of trial and   error by taking the car to the drag strip or by top speed runs, then evaluating   the horsepower gains by comparing the performance gains.</span><span class="style12"><br/>
</span><span class="style3B"><br/>
                      The last   choice is, of course, the chassis dynamometer. We felt this method was the best   way to test the actual installed horsepower of the engine by measuring the   output at the rear wheels, the unit we used was an electric dynamometer   utilizing 18-inch rollers. Horsepower readings were obtained by a torque arm   working through a potentiometer, the current being supplied by two synchronous   generators driven by the rollers.<br/>
<br/>
                      It is very difficult to come up with a   100 percent formula for converting chassis horsepower figures into actual   crankshaft horsepower, so we will not concern ourselves with this matter here.   We'll merely give the actual meter readings from the horsepower scale as well as   the various rpm at which the readings were obtained. Thus, we will have a   comparison of "before and after" readings as well as a general curve where one   can readily see in what rpm range the changes were most effective<strong>.</strong></span></p></td>

<td colspan="2" height="147"><p align="justify" class="style4R"><strong>Enriching Carburetor Air/Fuel   Ratio<br/>
<br/>
<span class="style3B">Our first run on the dyno gave us a rear wheel rating of 65   horsepower at 4000 rpm. The air-fuel ratio meter read 14:1, from past   experience; this had proven to be quite lean on our particular meter, so we   immediately decided the first step would be to enrich the mixture slightly for a   little better horsepower reading. The standard jet was found to be 62F, so we   decided to enlarge the jet size to 63.5. Our second run on the dyno brought the   air-fuel ratio to 13.4:1 and netted us a reading of 71 horsepower at the rear   wheels (which proved to us we were headed in the right direction).<br/>
<br/>
                                The next   step was to ascertain if we had gone far enough, so we decided to drill the main   jet out to a size .067. This produced a further increase to 75 horsepower at the   rear wheels with an air-fuel ratio of 12.5:1. So as not to confuse the issue, I   should state that my selection would be the .065 jet size for all-around usage   where one would seek horsepower and good economy simultaneously. </span></strong></p></td>

<td height="75"><p align="justify"><span class="style4R"><strong>Ignition Timing</strong></span><strong><br/>
<br/>
<span class="style3B">We then took a check on the spark lead and its effect on the   horsepower we were getting at the rear wheels. An initial lead of 10° offered us   the best all-around ignition setting, even though factory specifications called   for 5°.</span></strong></p></td>

<td height="153"><p align="justify"><span class="style4R"><strong>Effects of Thermactor</strong></span><strong><br/>
<br/>
<span class="style3B">By removing the air cleaner, we were able to come up with an   additional one horsepower rating, which in this day and age is not bad. We were   also curious about the Thermactor device, so we disconnected this unit and took   another horsepower test. Lo and behold, we neither gained nor lost a significant   amount of power. This should be a revelation to a1l of the people who have cars   equipped with anti-smog devices -- they do not seriously affect the horsepower   output of the car. On the other hand, I must confess that such units do not help   the idle nor the low speed running. However, where they are required by law, I   would certainly recommend you leave them as is, and be certain they are   operating properly.</span></strong></p></td>
