<p>While there hasn't been any new news lately, we thought we add an update since it's been so long since the last one. The inline sixes seem to be making a huge comeback, as more and more guys are keeping their sixes, rather than swapping them out for small block  V8. Much of this has to do with the availability of performance products, which is considerably better than it was ten years ago. And hopefully in the years to come, Classic Inlines will  introduce many more. Things like fuel injection, MLS head gaskets, kits for supercharging and turbocharging, and so on. Just in the past ten years we added over thirty new products, like our aluminum cylinder head, valve cover, cold air induction, ignition kits, stainless steel headers, and complete exhaust kits. And we did it  while the economy was in a shambles. Imagine what we can do, if and when the economy picks up? 
                    I remember when Will and Kelly's 63 Falcon ran  mid 12's in the quarter mile, and shocked everybody. However it wasn't  long before Kelly was running in the mid 11's consistently, which we all thought was pretty incredible. Then she shocked us all once more when she broke into the tens. Simply amazing..... As of today her best ET is 10.68, which we all thought was impossible just a few years ago.  I also remember when we all thought 200 HP, naturally aspirated, was pretty amazing.  Today that's pretty common, thanks to the aluminum head, and 300 HP is just around the corner. As for maximum HP, who knows? However I don't think it will be long before someone builds a small six that's grinding out  650-700 HP, that's streetable. As for me, I've had a blast over the past ten years. I only hope the next ten will be as good. Thanks for all the support.<strong> 4-10-2012</strong> </p>

<span class="style3B">August 2006 C.I. purchased a 69 Sports Roof  with   the intentions  of doing restomod rebuild sometime in the near future. The Sports Roof  originally came with an inline six, so we felt it was a perfect platform for a   turbo-charged fuel injected rebuilt six. We contacted Mustang &amp; Fords   magazine and asked if they were interested in our project for a future tech article, and got their reply without any hesitation. They loved the idea of building one of the hottest inline sixes ever conceived.  Our plans were to  build a  mustang which  could  be street driven, yet  offer stiff competition to its V8 counterparts at the track. At the same time, the little six would offer superior handling due to the reduced nose weight, better gas mileage, and a boat load of bottom end  torque. For detailed information on the entire build up, look for the three part  article in the October, November, and December 07 issues of Mustangs &amp; Fords magazine. </span></div></td>

Between races her husband, Will, takes care of the mechanicals, but its not unusual to find Kelly under the hood turning the wrenches too. Classic Inlines was fortunate to meet them just about the same time they started racing the falcon, and an agreement was struck to use the falcon as a test bed for our new products. 
                    Future plans call for the installation of a new solid lifter cam, which is needed to take full advantage of the air flow provided by the new aluminum cylinder head. The short term goal is  to get the car into the low tens, however once that's accomplished they plan to turn down the boost and lower the speeds. The car has the original interior and paint, which is still in great shape, therefore they prefer leaving it as is, without  a roll bar. Hence the long term goal is to run more consistent times, with hopes of winning a few trophies, and Kelly's just the one to do it. Over the past two years, the Falcon has been featured in Mustangs &amp; Fords and Car Craft, and pictures  pop up from time to time in other magazines as well, making the Falcon somewhat of a celebrity in the inline world. Congratulations Will and Kelly for a job well done, we look forward to a long and successful relationship.<strong> <a href="race_img.html#falcon">(more pics)</a><span class="style4RL"> </span></strong><br/>

The car will be owned and sponsored by Classic Inlines, however the plans call for Will to be both the mechanic and driver. Our  goal is to reach the low to mid nines, with an all out effort in building a race car under 2200 lbs, verses the current 2800 lbs. Power will be provided with a turbo charged and injected 250ci inline  six utilizing the new aluminum head and a custom Hogan intake.
