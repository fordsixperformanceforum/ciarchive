<p align="center" class="style3B">I think that you provide a great service and great   technical advise for the Ford inline six community. I am grateful that I can go   to a web site and find out all this information on a not so popular motor. Your   web site makes it so much easier to find the parts we all need for the projects   that we tend to endeavor. </p>
<p align="center" class="style3B"><img height="2" src="images/hr.gif" width="350"/></p>
<p align="center" class="style3B">Many thanks. The parts look great. I look forward   to doing more business with you. <br/>
              Your web site gives me one more thing to be   thankful for this year. I was concerned about another company going under and   losing a place to buy the parts I need. This has been a fresh breath for me and   you are keeping my dream alive. Thanks again. </p>
<p align="center" class="style3B"><img height="2" src="images/hr.gif" width="350"/></p>
<p align="center" class="style3B"> Thanks for sending the pictures of your installed parts, it answered all   my question and I now have no concerns about ordering from Classic Inlines. In fact, I   bought those headers today as well as the holly air cleaner, and chrome valve   cover kit. You guys have a really great store. Most other places that I've been   looking at buying stuff at have never emailed me back when I ask questions.   Thanks a lot for all your help.</p>
<p align="center" class="style3B"><img height="2" src="images/hr.gif" width="350"/></p>
<p align="center" class="style3B">Great   products, great service, great prices. What more can we ask for. <br/>
              I received   the parts today. They were exactly as promised and well packaged. Keep me on   your list as I plan on buying more parts in the very near future. Thanks for all   your help. </p>
<p align="center" class="style3B"><img height="2" src="images/hr.gif" width="350"/></p>
<p align="center" class="style3B">Just to let you know, I did go through the degreeing   process several times with my new cam and gears. It turns out the way I had   originally assembled it "like stock",  the cam was retarded 6-7 degrees. I did   end up advancing the cam about 3-4 degrees advanced, off of the true 112 split.   I compared the parts and the crank gear is indexed the same as the original 68,   but the cam gear key was rotated slightly. I heard somewhere the most common   stock gear sets were retarded for smog.   Luckily I followed your advice about   degreeing.  At the speed shop they asked me why I was getting into it, was I   really going racing in a big way? I explained about the rumors of the retarded   timing gears and they left me alone after that. Thanks for the advice. </p>
<p align="center" class="style3B"><img height="2" src="images/hr.gif" width="350"/></p>
<p align="center" class="style3B"> I've   bought several parts from Classic Inlines, including a deep sump oil pan, double roller   timing chain &amp; gears and a chrome thermostat housing. They offer excellent   service and super fast shipping and I highly recommend them and their products!   I plan on buying more products in the future! Thanks. </p>
<p align="center" class="style3B"><img height="2" src="images/hr.gif" width="350"/></p>
<p align="center" class="style3B"> Received   the coated header today, they look great. It was far better than I thought it   would be. I will be dropping the parts off tomorrow so they can finish the head   and then assemble the motor. I am starting to get excited.  I would not be as   far along as I am without your help. Thanks again. </p>
<p align="center" class="style3B"><img height="2" src="images/hr.gif" width="350"/></p>
<p align="center" class="style3B"> I just wanted to thank you   for your cam recommendations. At first I was very skeptical of the profile you   suggested for my 200, but after having it dyno'd today, I found out it was right   on. It was exactly what I needed to gain the performance I wanted and at the   correct rpm levels. I was worried the lobe centers would be to close and the   idle would suffer, but the motor sounds and runs great. Thanks for reassuring me   and convincing me to go with the profile you suggested. You are the best and   really know your products. I love the new web site too and have spent a lot of   time looking at all the various pages. There is just so much information   available and it was a great assistance when I was deciding how to build the   motor. Thanks for all your help and time. You have a dedicated customer for all   my inline needs and I will pass on the word to all my friend and acquaintances.   Great web site. </p>
<p align="center" class="style3B"><img height="2" src="images/hr.gif" width="350"/></p>
<p align="center" class="style3B">I  just picked up a jet coated pacemaker header from Classic Inlines.    Very very nice. Good price and a very high quality part. Now I just have to find   the time to install it. </p>
<p align="center" class="style3B"><img height="2" src="images/hr.gif" width="350"/></p>
<p align="center" class="style3B"> When I ordered my camshaft from you, you recommended   your 80 lb springs, which I sadly declined buying. A few weeks ago, my motor   started running poorly and after checking into it, I discovered the springs I   went with were to weak and were binding under the higher lift of the new cam. My   machinist said I need to replace the cam now as it has been damaged and is no   good. I should have listened to you in the first place. I just ordered a   replacement cam, and the springs you suggested in the first place. Please pass   on my experience to all your other cam customers so they don't make the same   mistake I did. Thanks for all your help. </p>
<p align="center" class="style3B"><img height="2" src="images/hr.gif" width="350"/></p>
<p align="center" class="style3B">Wanted to let you know the header arrived.  I want YOU to   know how much I appreciate and respect what you are doing for the inline crowd.    Thanks for a great web site and all the personal attention. </p>
<p align="center" class="style3B"><img height="2" src="images/hr.gif" width="350"/></p>
<p align="center" class="style3B"> When I   started planning the rebuild on my 65 Mustang Coupe I was deciding to either   swap in a V8 or keep the six cylinder.  I wanted the advantages the six cylinder   would give me,  fuel efficiency and a light weight engine. Yet enough power to   run a 5-speed overdrive and rear gears for performance.  I started looking for   parts to get "More" out of that 200 cid.  I found that there were not many   companies offering parts for these engines, and that the ones that did were very   expensive.  After finding Classic Inlines and contacting Mike about my engine, he   was able to help me put together an order for parts (some items I could not find   anywhere else)  at a more reasonable price.  I purchased a set of Dual Out   Headers, Full Roller Rockers,  Dual Roller Timing Chain, Hydraulic Cam, and   Chrome Moly Pushrods.  All are high quality parts and a worthy investment.   I   also sent him my intake manifold to have it Jet-Hot coated  along with the   headers, both of which came out fantastic... the quality is great.   Mike was   great with all of my questions, helped me find other parts I needed to complete   the job, and I would to do business with him again.  I would and do recommend   Classic Inlines anytime I can. </p>
<p align="center" class="style3B"><img height="2" src="images/hr.gif" width="350"/></p>
<p align="center" class="style3B"> I recently   received a very nice set of headers that I purchased from Classic Inlines. Nice welds, thick flanges, and heavy gauge tubing.  The fit was perfect   with nice clearance around the starter and motor mounts.  Highly recommended! </p>
<p align="center" class="style3B"><img height="2" src="images/hr.gif" width="350"/></p>
<p align="center" class="style3B"> When I   dropped my parts off at the machinist on Friday he was not there. He called me   this morning to say he has never seen such nice parts for the Ford Six. I   purchased a set of headers, dual timing chain, and a set of full roller rockers.   I also had the headers and my 2v intake Jet-Hot coated. My machinist was very   impressed, as was I.  Thanks CI.</p>
<p align="center" class="style3B"><img height="2" src="images/hr.gif" width="350"/></p>
<p align="center" class="style3B"> I just finished installing a set of the pacemakers on   my '63 Falcon Futura this weekend. Stock 170 with the Ford-O-Matic transmission.   Good clearance around the starter, motor mounts, and generator (A little close   to the rubber splash shield, but not too difficult to remedy). I had never   installed headers on a car before, so didn't know what to expect. It ended up   taking me twice as long as I originally thought that it would, but I have to   admit that they look sweet in there. The only area that I am having a contact   issue with is the bottom, horizontal portion of the dipstick tube for the   transmission. But I think that I can nudge the tube a little bit for the   clearance. I was very impressed with the quality of the headers.  I am really   looking forward to feeling the difference. Thanks! </p>
<p align="center" class="style3B"><img height="2" src="images/hr.gif" width="350"/></p>
<p align="center" class="style3B">I   purchased a header gasket from Classic Inlines. Before using the Classic Inlines gasket,<br/>
              I use to blow   mine constantly. I installed the your header gasket, and have not had a<br/>
              leak   since. This was a year ago. Thanks for a great product. </p>
<p align="center" class="style3B"><img height="2" src="images/hr.gif" width="350"/></p>
<p align="center" class="style3B">I   originally bought a deep sump oil pan, double roller timing chain &amp; gears   and a chrome thermostat housing. Since then (because of the great service &amp;   quality of parts), I purchased a set of dual out headers, "Hi-Po" balancer, ARP   head studs, oversize intake &amp; exhaust valves and sent a bunch of engine   parts to be jet hot coated. I continue to be much satisfied with their parts and   have built one of the fastest Ford 6 cylinder mustangs in my part of the   country!! I have other engine projects in the works and I will continue to buy   all my parts from Classic Inlines!! Thanks a bunch!!</p>
<p align="center" class="style3B"><img height="2" src="images/hr.gif" width="350"/></p>
<p align="center" class="style3B">Thanks for the quick response. It is great to have a parts   store who is so quick and easy to deal with as you, never mind the fact that   your dealing in hard to find parts at amazing prices. Again thanks for making   things clear and I will gladly do business again with you! Thanks</p>
<p align="center" class="style3B"><img height="2" src="images/hr.gif" width="350"/></p>
<p align="center" class="style3B">I   have been amazed at the quality of the parts that I have received which came in   earlier than expected.  I want to thank Classic Inlines for a good job on getting the word   out about the 6 cylinder mustangs and others like it.  Awesome work!!!  I will   continue to check and tell people about your web site for upcoming additions and   tech info.  Keep up the good work.</p>
<p align="center" class="style3B"><img height="2" src="images/hr.gif" width="350"/></p>
<p align="center" class="style3B">Just wanted to take the time to thank you for the headers.    They installed easily and sound great. The guys at the exhaust shop were very   impressed and said they have never done a mustang with dual out header like   that.  I told them about the site, just in case they run across anybody who is   looking for headers.  Here are a few pics of the finished product. Thanks Again!</p>
<p align="center" class="style3B"><img height="2" src="images/hr.gif" width="350"/></p>
<p align="center" class="style3B">I just installed the Pacemaker dual out headers on my 1969   250ci Sportsroof Mustang. I will be going to the Muffler shop latter this   week to have the 2" dual exhaust installed with a set of 40 series Flowmaster.   Just wanted to say thanks for the FAST shipping. The header looks great. Thanks </p>
<p align="center" class="style3B"><img height="2" src="images/hr.gif" width="350"/></p>
<p align="center" class="style3B">I finally got the   engine together &amp; the exhaust system installed. Yes the full length hooker   headers hang a little low but should not cause a problem, their fit was perfect.   The muffler shop did a great job going from the headers to a 2" pipe then   through an X pipe then to dual flow master hush power II mufflers. Man what a   difference in power, this thing runs as good as a stock 289. The owner of the   muffler shop commented it was the best sounding six he has heard &amp; the most   responsive. The engine is crisp &amp; the idle is nice with the 264 @ 112 lobe   center. Presently i have a Holley 500 on their but may try the 350 Holley to see   if their is any improvement in driveability. Again a great tribute to your   performance products. It took the six from a driver status to the next level.   Thanks again.</p>
<p align="center" class="style3B"><img height="2" src="images/hr.gif" width="350"/></p>
<p align="center" class="style3B">I would like to say thanks for the great   parts you provide, all the parts I ordered from you last fall are all excellent   pieces, it helped my rebuild go together very smoothly. I hope to have my 200 up   and running by the end of June. Thanks!</p>
