<td colspan="2" height="489" width="100%"><p align="justify">The 250 Falcon engine with integral manifold is limited in performance due to   the restrictive nature of the cylinder head. To get the most out of it requires   radical modifications to improve both intake and exhaust flow. Several rodders   have resorted to "hacking off the intake and exhaust" and some have even   imported Australian or Argentinean cylinder heads to alleviate the problem.</p>
<p align="justify">I decided that the original head design is very limited and   elected to import a better engine to replace it: the Alloy Head Crossflow. First   introduced in 1976 with an iron head and in 1978 with an alloy head, the   Crossflow six is essentially a "Cleveland" version of the six. With its canted   valves and 1.73 ratio rockers, the Crossflow has the potential for far more   power output than the integral manifold Falcon six can ever reach. Our goal is a   meager 200 naturally aspirated hp!</p>

<br/>
<p align="justify">The Crossflow is a direct development of the earlier 250 2V and   shares many parts with the US 250. The reciprocating assembly is similar and   many of the external mounting bosses are the same. The common ancestry makes   this engine a relatively easy replacement for the US250 six.</p>

</strong>I picked up the Crossflow at the freight terminal in Orlando,   Florida. The engines are in my garage and I am disassembling and measuring as I   go.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>1/11/01</strong><strong><br/>
</strong>I started   pulling apart the carb'd engine and measured a few things along the way. Overall   the engine looks sound, but in need of a rebuild. A .020 cut will easily clean   up the bores. The head has normal carbon buildup, but looks good. No burnt   valves, no valve recession.</p>

<div align="left">The block is almost, but not exactly, like the US250 on the   bottom end. Many of <br/>
                        the mounting bosses are the same so PS brackets, AC and   Alt will bolt on. The <br/>
                        distance between the engine mount bosses is about 1"   narrower, so mounting <br/>
                        the Crossflow in the Mustang should be even easier than   a US 250. The oil pressure <br/>
                        sender is in the same location. If the Crossflow   has one drawback, it's the fact that <br/>
                        the head will not fit a US block. The   Oz deck is wider to accommodate the cylinder <br/>
                        head and the Cleveland style   valve train. </div>

<div align="left">Neither the EFI or the Carb distributor have any advance   mechanisms. Both <br/>
                        engines were equipped with computer controlled spark   advance. One is equipped <br/>
                        with a TFI module. Both have aluminum bodied Bosch   coils.<br/>

<div align="left">The Crossflow distributor body has the same dimensions, but the   shaft is smaller, <br/>

                        hole in the block to the larger size. The   distributor hold down is located in a different <br/>

                        could be made to work in a non-emissions application. The   manifold isn't very HiPo, <br/>
                        but with a DGV would make a decent street manifold   and is still worlds better than <br/>

<p align="justify">That's all for now. I'm shooting some photos (digital and 35mm)   as I go so that slows me down a bit. More to follow as I complete the   teardown.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>1/12/01<br/>
</strong>Started the teardown on the EFI   Crossflow this evening. Pretty good news. The head looks like it was rebuilt.   Not as much corrosion as the other. Very clean, looks in good shape. Also the   cylinder bores look very good. Standard bores without a ridge, worn about   .001-.003" . Still within factory specs. Looks like a simple re-ring will do it. </p>
<p align="center"><a href="Tech%20Images/heads.html" onclick="MM_openBrWindow('img_popups/crossflow_img06.html','','resizable=yes,width=500,height=500')"><img border="2" height="216" src="images/Tech_images/Crossflow/headsM.jpg" width="288"/></a> <br/>
<em>Above, EFI head, below carb head. <br/>
              Note the   difference in chamber shape </em></p>
<p align="justify">No doubt the engine is old, though. Some crusty stuff on the   crank, badly worn timing chain (so loose it will almost fall out), bearings are   all worn out. Crank still specs out good, though. The bearings interchange   between the US and Oz engines.</p>
<p align="justify">The Oz 250 and the US250 blocks are similar but not identical.   The US250 is about 1" wider at the pan rail (and engine mounts), which will make   it easier to transplant the Oz motor, but makes the pan different and not   interchangeable. Likewise the timing covers will not interchange. On the pan and   timing cover, the Oz motor looks like it is closer in dimension to the 200.</p>
<p align="justify">The deck height is about .100 shorter than the US 250. The US   250 rods and pistons will fit, but compression height is about .024 shorter on   the US piston. The Oz piston also has a deep recessed bowl. I have not cc'd it   yet. Another noted difference is that the EFI piston uses narrow low tension   rings.</p>
<p align="justify">The oil pumps will interchange, but the US pump has bigger   gears and possibly more volume. The pickups will also interchange.</p>
<p align="justify">Timing chains are different. The Oz motor uses smaller gears   similar to the 200. Might even be the same. The US250 uses larger gears and a   longer chain. The US250 cam seems to be higher in the block.</p>
<p align="justify">The main caps are beefier on the Oz motor. A bit wider and   heavier looking.</p>
<p align="justify">The rods look a lot like the C9 rods. They have identical   dimensions (5.88" center to center, .912" pin) and are interchangeable. ARP   289/302 5/16" rod bolts fit perfectly.</p>
<p align="justify">The Oz water pump is alloy vs cast iron. It has a steel plate   sandwiched between the pump and the impeller. Judging from the amount of   silicone I found on both engines, leakage might be a problem. I cannot figure   out how to change the inner gasket without pressing the pump apart. I think that   if you ever develop a leak, you have to put on a new pump. The US250 pump will   interchange and I think I will use it instead.</p>
<p align="justify">The overall height of the EFI 250 is less than the US250. Even   with the plenum in the stock location, it sits lower than the air cleaner I use   now.</p>
<p align="justify">I'll have more room than I have now. A quick measurement of the   engine compartment shows that the headers I got from Mike at <a href="index.html">Classic Inlines</a>, which were special   ordered for me, should fit fine. </p>
<p align="justify">The combustion chambers on the EFI head are different than the   Carb'd head. haven't cc'd them yet, but the carb'd head should have 50cc   chambers vs. 56 for the EFI. The valves in both are the same size 1.80/1.49. See   photo above.</p>
<p align="justify">So far the verdict is that the engines are more like cousins,   not siblings. There's some commonality which helps with the interchange, but   enough uniqueness that Oz parts are required. However, once I get a T-5 adapted,   this will be a slam dunk, swap-wise.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>1/13/01<br/>
</strong>Tore the EFI bottom end down today   and as suspected the bearings are worn. Fortunately, the crank is still good and   will not need turning. </p>
<p align="justify">The front seal was brittle and probably leaking. The previous   owner obviously tried to stop the leak by stuffing the balancer retaining bolt   hole with silicone! There was also some silicone glopped onto the outside of the   pan in what looked like an effort to stop a leak at the pan gasket! Guy must   have owned stock in a silicone factory.</p>
<p align="justify">As I pointed out earlier, the bearing caps are a little heftier   than the US250's. The block casting is very well done. The bearings are   identical to the US250 with one exception. The Oz motor only uses a thrust   surface on the block side as opposed to the US bearing which has a thrust   surface on the cap also. This means I will have to trim away the thrust surface   from the cap bearing shell in order to use it in the OZ motor. easy enough to   do.</p>
<p align="justify">While the Oz block is very nicely done, I can't say the same   for the crank. It has a lot of casting flash hanging off of it. I'll clean that   off with a grinder. The only apparent difference between the US250 and Oz crank   is that the US crank has a slinger cast in just ahead of the rear main seal   area. If that were machined off, the US250 crank could be used.</p>
<p align="justify">The US250 AC/Alternator and the PS pump brackets bolt on to   existing bosses in the Oz block, so that makes things easier if you intend to   use them.</p>
<p align="justify">I will ream the block out to use a Duraspark distributor   tomorrow. The block is machined for a .485" distributor shaft. The Duraspark   shaft is .515"</p>
<p align="justify">After a thorough scrubbing, I painted the block Ford blue.   Looks pretty nice. I mocked up the 2 bbl manifold with the DGV Weber and it is   over 1" shorter than the US250/YF combination. This should fit nicely in the   Mustang.</p>
<p align="center"><a href="Tech%20Images/2Vmockup.html"><img border="2" height="216" hspace="10" src="images/Tech_images/Crossflow/2VmockupM.jpg" width="288"/></a> <a href="Tech%20Images/2Vmockup2.html"><img border="2" height="216" src="images/Tech_images/Crossflow/2Vmockup2M.jpg" width="288"/></a><br/>
<em>The bare   EFI block mocked up with the headers and 2v intake </em></p>
<p align="justify"><strong>1/15/01 <br/>
</strong>It turns out the main bearings are   slightly different. They'll have to come from Oz. JD has already picked up two   sets for me and they are on the way. The biggest problem it that the thrust   bearing is wider than the US version. The crank is machined wider to fit. So   though I can get the other 6 1/2 shells to go in, the thrust bearing is not   going to work. So far that means that gaskets and main bearings will have to be   imported.</p>
<p align="justify">I also found that 351C, Boss 302, and Big Block Chevy's all   carry the same part number for roller rockers. That makes them very available.   I'm ordering custom 5/16" pushrods from Comp Cams. The lifters are just small   block Ford, so those are easy.</p>
<p align="justify">I mocked up the engine again with the brackets. The US brackets   fit, but are a bit clunky. I believe I will use the Oz alternator and A/C   bracket. I'm eliminating the power steering so that's no problem.</p>
<p align="justify">I reamed the distributor shaft opening to .515" in order to use   the Duraspark. When I placed it on the mockup, the distributor turned out to be   too tall. The cap hits the intake runner. I will have to use the Duraspark   internals in a points type body.</p>
<p align="justify">At first I considered just a re-ring and bearings, but I've   since had a change of heart. The engine will be over-bored (specs undetermined)   and a trip to the machine shop is planned. I am going to use US pistons in the   first mild motor. The pistons I have sourced have a shallow dish, but not as   much compression height. The CR will still go up to about 9.2:1 - an increase   from the stock 8.89:1 CR.</p>
<p align="left">The US250 water pump and oil pump fit perfectly.</p>

<p align="justify"><strong>2/2/01</strong><br/>
                It's been awhile since the last   update. I finally got pistons, rings, and the Aussie main bearings. The block   was dropped off at the machine shop last Tuesday and will be ready for pickup   Monday. I can start assembly next week. When I pick this block up, I'll drop the   second block off for the same treatment.</p>
<p align="justify">In the meantime, I decided that I would just skip straight   ahead to the EFI installation. Originally the plan was to build a carbureted   "mule" just to test out, but a group purchase on an SDS system became available   and I placed an order. I am getting the <a href="http://www.sdsefi.com/" target="_blank">SDS EM3E</a> system to control both   the fuel and timing. I'll retain the MSD 6A as the triggering device, but will   be using crank mounted magnetic triggers. I intend to use the big cam with the   EFI. The tunability of the SDS will allow me to adjust the fuel and ignition   curve to suit. </p>
<p align="justify">I also found a good T-5 and have ordered a tranny adapter from   Sacramento Mustang. I need to give some thought to the clutch mechanism. The   mechanical linkage is an option, but I may go hydraulic. I gotta think on that   one some more.</p>
<p align="justify">I've begun removing the US250 from the Mustang and have pretty   much everything disconnected and ready to pull. Perhaps this weekend I'll have it   out so I can clean the engine bay.</p>
<p align="justify">Monday I'm taking some things over to have them ceramic coated.   Right now it's just headers, timing cover, and valve cover. I may do the EFI   runners and plenum, but the budget is getting tight. I'm getting real close to   eating into the paint budget!</p>
<p align="justify">I also ordered all the parts to convert back to manual   steering. While the engine is out, I'll do that swap too.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>2/08/01</strong><br/>
                The machine shop did a great job. I   got the reciprocating assembly together this evening and it looks pretty good.   New core plugs installed, and threaded plugs for the oil gallery. Plastigaged   the crank before final assembly and it is right on spec. Crank, pistons, rods,   rings, cam, timing gears, and oil pump are all together now and turn real   nicely. The gap-less rings don't have much drag. I'll put the pickup and pan on   later and will seal it up. My flywheel was also machined and ready to bolt   on.</p>
<p align="center"><strong><a href="Tech%20Images/bottomend.html" onclick="MM_openBrWindow('img_popups/crossflow_img11.html','','resizable=yes,width=500,height=500')"><img border="2" height="216" src="images/Tech_images/Crossflow/bottomendM.jpg" width="288"/></a><br/>
</strong><em>Bottom End assembled</em></p>
<p align="justify">The roller timing gear fits the cam and crank tighter than the   stock gears. They had to be persuaded with a brass drift but fit just fine. I   degreed the 292 cam and installed it straight up.</p>
<p align="justify">After assembly, I measured again and the Compression Ratio   should be right at 9.5:1, just what we were shooting for.</p>
<p align="justify">The order is being filled at SDS and may ship tomorrow or   Monday. I should have it within the week! I went to the aircraft surplus store   at lunchtime today and got some aluminum for the crank trigger brackets.   Tomorrow, I finish pulling the old 250. Sat/Sun I have to work, so progress will   be slow.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>2/10/01</strong><br/>
                Budget realities set in. I have to   abandon some of the appearance items I was planning. No ceramic coating, no   complete new interior, no fiberglass body parts. It's going to be mechanically   the same as planned, but none of the high-vis parts on the outside. So, in the   end it'll be a Titanium Silver metallic coupe, with the same AR CP200 wheels,   Fuelie Crossflow, T-5, and newer, better tires. Still a good plan, I think. And   still fast as heck!</p>

                Valentines Day! I had the afternoon   off and was able to finish assembly of the block and EFI runners. I spent a hour   or so checking Piston-to-Valve clearances with clay. I have a couple of solid   lifters that work real well for that. I have no clearance problems at all.</p>
<p align="justify">I had to use the US250 oil pump drive because the Oz oil pump   drive shaft was too long when using the US pump. I also used the US 250 pickup   tube because is was larger. The engine turns very easily. I think the gap-less   rings have less tension than regular rings. It only takes about 40 lb ft of   torque to turn the assembled engine even with the rockers hooked up and the   valves operating.</p>
<p align="justify">I'll have to pull the balancer again later to mount the crank   trigger magnets. You'll notice the Bosch distributor. Since the timing and   ignition advance will be handled by the SDS, there's no need for any sort of   advance on the distributor. It's only there to handle the spark.</p>
<p align="justify">This thing looks tall, but is actually shorter than the carb'd   US250 by over an inch, counting the carb and air cleaner.</p>

<em>Assembled and almost ready</em> </p>
<p align="justify"><strong>2/15/01</strong><br/>
                The T-5 adapter from California   Pony Cars arrived today. It's simply a cast plate which locates the tranny in   the bell housing, spaces the tranny out by about 3/4", and gives you a T-5 bolt   pattern. The adapter requires that you drill two holes and tap one to mount the   adapter. After that it just simply goes together!</p>

<p align="justify"><strong>2/16/01</strong><br/>
                Today I pulled the old 250 and AOD.   I had forgotten how heavy that transmission is. It weighs about 165 lbs with   converter and fluid - nearly twice what the T5 weighs, even with the iron   bell housing attached. I pulled the transmission separately from the engine and   dropped it out from underneath the car. I didn't want to drain all that fluid   (15qts). It's still in good shape and I hope someone who's doing an AOD   conversion can use it.</p>
<p align="justify">After I got the engine out, I decided to go ahead and drop the   Crossflow in just to check fit of the intake and headers. In order to get this   engine in when it's assembled, the export brace has to come out.</p>
<p align="justify">The engine fit easily on the frame mounts using the original   1966 motor mounts.The pan clears the steering linkage and it looks pretty good.   The number six intake runner is pretty close to the export brace, but there's   about 3/8" clearance, so we'll see how it looks after the tranny is in and all   the angles are correct. The headers are almost perfect. The number three tube   rubs the center of the shock tower, but that's easily corrected. I put the hood   back on and checked for hood clearance. I have nearly 2" above the intake   plenum, far more than I had with the air cleaner on the US250.</p>
<p align="justify">The brake master cylinder looks pretty close to the intake   runners, but there's still room to work on it.</p>

                Today the engine came back out so   that I could clean the engine compartment. It wasn't that bad, but a little   touch up with some satin black Krylon helps a lot. After I took the engine out I   test fit the flywheel, clutch, pressure plate and transmission. Amazingly, it   fits like it was designed to all go together.</p>
<p align="justify">Three things cropped up after I put it together and started   measuring. First, the T-5 combo is about 1 1/2" longer than the AOD. I'll have   to have the drive shaft shortened. Second, the tranny mounting pad is about 1"   closer to the block than the AOD, but there's more than enough adjustment   available on the Windsor-Fox cross member. Third, the 3.8 T-bird starter will not   fit. The orientation of the nose is wrong. It places the engagement cover   directly against the block. I'll need a 200 starter. All these things are easily   dealt with and the swap is looking good.</p>
<p align="justify">I still have to figure out how to mount the hydraulic master   cylinder. I still think I may have to remove the power brake booster.</p>

</strong><em>Here you see the old 250/AOD side by side with the   Crossflow. You can see the family resemblance</em></p>
<p align="justify"><strong>3/20/01<br/>
</strong>It's been a few days since the last   update. Between work related travel to Korea and the family vacation to Germany,   not much has happened in the garage. This week I'll take care of a few details   and will begin prepping to reinstall the engine and transmission.</p>
<p align="justify">I've taken a closer look at the SDS EFI system. I've installed   the trigger magnets in the balancer, made patterns for the trigger sensor   bracket, and looked at mounting points for the ECU. I think I'll relocate the   MSD to the interior. I saw some interesting mounting trays in the surplus shop   which might be just the thing.</p>
<p align="justify">I'm beginning to realize the full magnitude of what I'm doing   here. An Aussie engine swap. Conversion from an AOD to a T-5 transmission.   There's the fuel injection. A hydraulic clutch. Electrical upgrades. Power to   Manual steering conversion. Cooling system. Paint, body, and interior. Whew! Any   one of those would be a major project in itself for most. I don't feel so bad   for not making significant progress.</p>
<p align="justify">I'll be going to the swap meet and car show in Daytona this   weekend. Maybe I'll find some bits there.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>3/28/01</strong><br/>
                The show in Daytona was pretty   good, but not a lot of parts unless you had a small block Chevy. I did pick up   some small tools and some factory stick on Ford ovals. I was a little   disappointed in the vendor turnout. Usually the bigger shows are a good place to   pick up catalogs, info, flyers, etc., but there were very few major players   there. Got a few things, but I guess I'll have to wait until the Good Guys show   this summer for the good stuff.</p>
<p align="justify">A few more bits and pieces are coming together for the   Crossflow. I went to the junkyard the other day and picked up a fuel pressure   regulator for a Volvo. Same as the Crossflow except it has a barbed fitting for   the return line. That'll make hookup easier. Also picked up a short piece of the   the Volvo fuel rail. I brought this home and welded it to the inlet. That allows   me to use a barbed high-pressure inlet fitting from the Volvo. I tapped a hole   in the intake plenum for the air temp sensor and picked up another Throttle   Position Sensor (TPS). The old TPS was giving me strange readings on the   multimeter.</p>
<p align="justify">I began making a mount for the ignition trigger. I have some   1/8" aluminum that will work out fine, but it occurs to me that it might   actually be better to weld a mounting boss onto the aluminum cover. I'll check   that out this week.</p>
<p align="justify">The clutch, pressure plate, and release bearing arrived   yesterday. It's a diaphragm type 10" unit. I originally wanted to use the 10.5"   setup, but clearance inside the bell housing is tight.</p>
<p align="justify">The second Crossflow is nearly ready to pickup at the machine   shop. It's going to be bagged a put aside either for sale of a future project.   Not sure what I'll do with it yet.</p>
<p align="justify">This weekend I plan to assemble the engine/tranny and maybe   install it in the car.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>6/25/01</strong><br/>
<em><strong>It's   Alive!!!</strong></em> It's been awhile since the last update. Between work and   family the progress was slow, but the engine is in and I fired it up for the   first time last week. The first full test drive was yesterday!</p>
<p align="justify">The engine is awesome! It pulls hard, strong, and quickly from   idle to the self imposed 5000 rpm redline. Once I have the car tuned a little   better I'll raise the fuel cutoff a bit higher to see where the power really   lies.</p>
<p align="justify">In the pictures below you can see the Chevy Cavalier aluminum   air cleaner and the cold air duct thru the fender well. Notice the insulation to   keep the header heat from heating up the intake hose. One disappointment has   been the headers. The very attractive cadmium plating turned out to be paint   which burned off in the first few minutes! Well, it looked good for a little   while. I guess I'll need to make a trip to HyperKote after all.</p>
<p align="justify">The white face gauge inserts are easy to read, especially after   removing the factory colored lenses and simply painting the bulbs blue with a   permanent marker. That's a Mustang II console with a Honda shift boot and a   handmade aluminum cup holder in place of the coin tray. Sitting on the seat is   the SDS programmer and my new $14 million dollar beret. The shift lever is an   original three speed lever with an adapter for the T-5 welded on by my good   friend Al Martin.</p>
<p align="justify">The T-5 was a great swap for this car. It absolutely transforms   the way the car drives. I'm not sure if we hit the 200 hp target, but we are   certainly very close. The car will incinerate the tires in first gear, and   wheel spin in second is no problem. The first test drive, we "accidentally" lit   up the tires in third on some damp pavement. A couple of impromptu runs to 60   netted us some times between 7-8 seconds - very quick! A locker would be nice to   have now!</p>
<p align="left">I have to turn my attention to paint and bodywork now!</p>
