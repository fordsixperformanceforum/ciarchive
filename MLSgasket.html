<p align="justify">               Cometic   Performance MLS (which stands for Multi-Layer Steel) Head Gaskets are comprised of three to five layers of stainless steel, depending on the thickness.   MLS head gaskets reduce bore distortion and with-stand extreme   cylinder pressures. The stainless steel outer layers are    coated with embossed viton, which offers improved  corrosive   resistance and a   superior seal between the cylinder head and block, with excellent rebound characteristics. Embossed gaskets also provide a superior  seal   around the oil and water passages.</p>
<p align="justify">Classic Inlines plans to offer MLS Head Gaskets in three standard  sizes (.027, .038, .050),  however we can  custom order gaskets in   any thickness, between .027  and  .140 (max). Prices will be around $160, which is Cometic's   Suggested Retail Price. We also plan to offer Cometic's <a href="http://www.cometic.com/phuzion.aspx"><strong>Phuzion</strong></a> gaskets, which are a must    for boosted (turbo or super charged) motors. <br/><br/>
              Here's an article I found,   which does a good job explaining the advantages of MLS gaskets, and why they are worth the extra money, verses a standard composite head gasket. <br/>
<br/>
<em>One thing no engine builder wants to   worry about is a head gasket failure, whether it is a NASCAR cup engine, a Pro   Stock drag racing engine, a hot street engine, or even a stock engine. Stock   head gaskets hold up well enough under normal loads, but as compression ratios   and pressures go up, stock head gaskets begin to fail. And once hot combustion   gasses start blowing past the gasket's combustion armor, bad things begin to   happen. The combustion armor cracks or burns through, compression is lost, and   the oil and coolant start finding new ways to circulate inside the engine, often   with negative consequences.<br/>
<br/>
              Over the years, performance engine builders   have used a variety of tricks to keep their engines sealed such as using wire   O-rings around combustion chambers and running solid copper head gaskets.   Various kinds of sealing solutions have also been developed by aftermarket   gasket manufacturers for sealing high performance engines such as high   temperature graphite and non-asbestos composition gaskets with special coatings   and beefed up combustion armor, head gaskets with stainless steel or copper wire   rings inside the combustion chamber armor for added reinforcement, and head   gaskets with oversized wire rings and combustion chamber armor that function   similar to O-rings.</em><br/>
<br/>
<em>One of the hottest products to emerge in recent years   for high performance engines are Multi-Layer Steel (MLS) head gaskets. MLS   gaskets first appeared on many Japanese engines in the late 1980s and early   1990s, and were later adopted by Ford, Chrysler, and General Motors.
               Unlike other types of gaskets,   MLS gaskets use a different strategy to seal the combustion chamber. They   typically use 3 to 5 layers of stainless steel to create a spring-like effect   that seals the gap between the head and block.<br/>
<br/>
              As engine compression, rpm   and combustion pressure go up, the cylinder head is pushed away from the block   every time the cylinders fire. The movement isn't enough to be seen with the   naked eye, but it can be measured - and it can be enough to break the seal   between the head and block with conventional gasket designs. The amount of lift   depends on cylinder pressures and how much the head bolts stretch. 
              To   maintain the seal when the head is pushed up and away from the block, the head   gasket has to expand as the head lifts. This requires a certain amount of   springiness or elasticity that can only be achieved with an MLS head gasket. The   multi-layer construction of MLS head gaskets allows the inner layer(s) to act   something like a valve spring. As the head lifts away from the block, the inner   layer(s) of the gasket push the outer layers apart to maintain the seal. The   spring steel expands and contracts without taking a permanent set or deforming   under load, and the gasket maintains its seal. That's why MLS gaskets have more   "vertical recovery" than other types of gaskets and can handle high pressure   applications.<br/>
<br/>
              In a stock engine, the maximum combustion pressures may   only reach about 1,000 psi. But in a performance engine, they can reach 1,500 to   2,200 psi under race conditions, and soar as high as 3,500 psi if the engine   goes into detonation. The higher the pressure, the greater the cylinder head   separation from the block - and the more the gasket has to expand and contract   to maintain its seal.<br/>
<br/>
              Aftermarket MLS performance gaskets are engineered   for racing and are not just copies of the OEM style gaskets. They have   strategically placed sealing beads around the combustion chambers and coolant   passages to concentrate clamping loads in the most critical areas. Some MLS   gaskets have an additional stainless steel "stopper ring" to further increase   sealing pressure around the combustion chambers (such as in Chevy LS1/LS6   engines). One gasket supplier (Cometic) has a line of MLS performance gaskets   that incorporate a unique "gas-filled ring" around the combustion chambers. The   pressure inside the ring is 600 to 700 psi, and increases as the engine heats up   to increase the clamping load and combustion seal. Features like these have   enabled MLS gaskets to become the gasket of choice for many forms of racing as   well as street performance applications. Many racers who used to   run copper heads gaskets have switched to MLS because the gaskets hold up just   as well and don't have the sealing or installation issues associated with copper   gaskets. <br/>
<br/>
              The all-steel construction of   MLS gaskets makes them almost bullet-proof under even the most extreme operating   conditions. The gaskets also have an exterior "Viton" or polymer coating that   helps them cold seal on less than ideal surfaces. Most original equipment MLS   require extremely smooth finishes (20 to 30 Ra) to seal, while most performance   MLS gaskets require a surface of 50 Ra or less. Some have thicker coatings that   can accommodate surface finishes as rough as 60 Ra. </em><strong>NOTE: The MLS Head Gaskets offered by Classic Inlines require 50   Ra.</strong><em><br/>
<br/>
              As for reusability, as long as the gasket appears to be in   good condition when it is removed, many racers find they can reuse MLS gaskets   with no problems. If the surface coating has a damaged spot or two, it can often   be repaired with a light coating of RTV silicone.
              The only drawback with MLS gaskets is the price, but they are well worth the money in the long run. <br/>
<br/>
              The   multi-layer construction of MLS head gaskets requires expensive precision   tooling, and 3 to 5 layers of stainless steel. Consequently, the jobber price   for a performance MLS head gasket for a small block Chevy V8 is around $70 to   $75 (per side). What's more, on some applications the cost is even higher   because of limited volume or availability. The jobber price for a MLS   performance head gasket for a sport compact engine such as Mitsubishi 2.0L, for   example, might be as high as $170. Of course, you only have to buy one for a   four cylinder (instead of two for a V8). An inline six will be  higher yet, as they   are longer and require more material. Some customers might balk at the cost, but   considering the durability these gaskets are capable of providing, paying top   dollar for a gasket that won't blow out or fail is more than worth the money.   And unlike composition gaskets that cannot be reused, MLS gaskets don't have to   be replaced every time the head comes off the engine.</em></p>
