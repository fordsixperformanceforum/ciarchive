<td bgcolor="#FFFFFF" colspan="2" height="489" width="100%"><p align="justify">The most common items over looked during assembly and installation of a rebuilt motor, are the <a href="products493d.html?cat=62">motor mounts</a>, transmission mounts, and the <a href="products2070.html?cat=65">harmonic damper</a> (balancer). Motor mounts are commonly bonded together using  a variety of rubber compounds, while most OEM dampers utilize an    elastomer (rubber) inertia ring, which is  pressed  into place.  Over the years the rubber compounds  dry out and become brittle,  eventually resulting in product failure.  In most cases these  failures  lead to un-necessary and costly repairs, and  they can be dangerous, even  life threatening, if they occur at the wrong moment. Therefore it is essential to thoroughly clean and inspect these parts prior to reuse. If the rubber or metal parts show  signs of cracking,  excessive wear, or have small pieces missing, they need to be rebuilt or replaced. </p>

</table>
<p align="justify">To select the proper damper, one first needs to understand it's purpose. A harmonic damper  is often referred to as a balancer, which seems to suggest that the   unit “balances” the engine. However it's actual function is to dampen torsional   vibrations which occur in the crankshaft. These vibrations are the  result of the combustion process,  or more accurately the sudden reversal of load on the   pistons, connecting rods, and the crankshaft. The subsequent   relaxation of the load, following the combustion event, causes a deflection or flexing of the   crankshaft.    At certain rpm ranges these oscillations  come into phase with each other, which generates potentially harmful and damaging torsional peaks within the crankshaft. This oscillating vibration, which results from the reciprocating load   changes, will remain in force until it is dissipated by internal friction and/or damping. Unless the amplitude of these torsional vibrations is   controlled, major damage can occur to engine components, such as rapid wear of   the timing gears, stretching or breakage of the timing chain, pitting or   cupping of the camshaft and lifters, broken valve springs and/or valve train   failure, or excessive wear  of the engine bearings. In extreme situations   these uncontrolled torsional vibrations can lead to  loose or broken flywheel bolts and/or  crankshaft failure, which may result in serious safety consequences.</p>
<p align="justify">As we stated earlier, most OEM and/or rebuilt  dampers utilize an    elastomer (rubber) inertia ring, which is  pressed  into place.  While this is adequate for low revving engines, it  won't  handle the higher torque and revolutions of a performance motor.  Using an old worn out damper, or an inadequate   damper for the application,  usually results in the spinning of the inertia   ring, which in turn results in the loss of timing accuracy and eventual component separation.   Even some of the more costly steel or alloy performance dampers use   a similar rubber insert, which  will break down over time, in  much the same way as   standard damper. </p>
<p align="justify">Classic Inlines offers three different harmonic dampers or <a href="products2070.html?cat=65">balancers</a>;  Rebuilt,  Performance Street, Performance Plus. All of our dampers are bonded<strong>, </strong>offering <strong><span class="style3B">superior strength and durability over  stock EOM dampers.</span></strong> Which one you use  depends on the  performance level of your motor. The Rebuilt balancer are great for stock or mild performance engines which normally operate under 5000 rpm. Our  Performance Street balancers are designed for performance inlines that spin up to 6500 rpm. Our Performance Plus balancers are similar to the Performance Street balancers, also good to 6500 rpm, however they feature an additional clear hard-coat for increased durability and appearance. <br/>
<br/>
              For engines that make over 400HP, or those that spend time on the strip, you may need an SFI Certified balancer. While Classic Inlines doesn't carry them, they can be purchased from ATI Performance Products. They don't show them in their catalog, but they will  custom build one for   $250-300 bucks, which isn't bad for a custom balancer. Eventually we hope to offer  SFI Certified balancers, but that's down the road a bit. <br/>
<br/>
<strong>
              REBUILT</strong><br/>
            Our Stock Rebuilt balancer are disassembled, cleaned, and inspected for defects. Including stripped bolt holes, worn or cracked keyways, cracked  center webbing, and there overall condition. Once they pass inspection they prepared for assembly, which includes resetting the timing marks    using a superior   laser aligning   process. The balancers are then    injected with a high-temperature, high-strength silicone rubber that is    platinum cured for a stronger bond. This new silicone rubber compound is capable   of withstanding temperatures in excess of 450 degrees, and will hold up to   pressures as high as 770 psi. All stock Rebuilt Balancers carry the manufacturers "Three Year Limited  Warranty". </p>
<p align="justify"><strong>PERFORMANCE</strong> <strong>STREET </strong><br/>
              The limiting factor with  rebuilt balancers, is that they use the stock  cast iron parts, which can crack in the keyway and/or center webbing. While the bonding process is far superior to new OEM balancers, the stock gray cast iron parts limit the revolutions to 5000 rpm. Our  Performance Street balancers solve this problem by using    new metal components, which are made  from  high strength nodular iron. Next, a state of art bonding process is utilized, which uses extreme heat and pressure to positively bond the dampening  compound  to the new metal components. By using  nodular iron and a superior bonding process, the  common failures which are associated with stock and/or rebuilt balancers are eliminated, thereby increasing the performance capabilities to 6500 rpm.    Performance Street balancers carry the manufacturers "One Year Limited Warranty". While these balancers may look like a stock  balancer, I can assure you they are not. The quality is far superior to that of a stock replacement balancer (se chart below). <br/>
<br/>
<strong>PERFORMANCE PLUS </strong><br/>
            Our Performance Plus balancers, which are similar to our Performance Street balancers,  feature an additional clear hard-coat finish for increased durability and appearance. Offering unmatched reliability for engines with increased horsepower and   torque, up to 6500rpm, they carry the  manufacturers "Two Year Limited Warranty". </p>

              While our bonded Rebuilt Balancers have four times the   strength of inserted rubber, in push apart and torque tests, our Performance   Street balancers have nine times the strength of inserted rubber and two and a   half times that of rebuilt balancers. <br/>

              The   SFI Foundation, Inc.  is a non-profit organization which was established to issue and   administer industry standards for specialty performance automotive and racing   equipment. The SFI Spec. 18.1 provides a set of minimum requirements, that    the manufacturer must comply with when producing crankshaft vibration dampers. The   standards were introduced to ensure safety on the track, where certain racing   classes require an SFI Certified damper, as specified by the sanctioning   body. The   specifications   stipulate the minimum mechanical properties for the steel used in the   construction, the requirement that the outer ring must be    retained in the event of a failure, and that the damper is subjected to spin test of 12,500   rpm for a minimum of one hour. <br/>

<p align="left">1)    Remove the balancer/damper carefully using a Professional damper   removal tool.</p>
<p>2)    Clean the crank snout with very fine abrasive paper to   ensure no burrs exist. </p>
<p align="left">3)    Check the bore of the balancer to ensure there is no paint   residue, if required clean<br/> 
            the area with very fine abrasive paper. </p>
<p>4)    Re-check the sizes, particularly the height of the   crankshaft key, as some aftermarket  keys do not meet OEM   specs.</p>
<p align="left">5)    Prior to installation heat the balancer in boiling water   for 15 minutes, or place it in a preheated oven at a low temperature (max 250 deg F   or 120 deg C) for 15 minutes. <br/>
<br/>
              6) Coat the crankshaft snout and inside diameter of the damper with an anti-seize compound or moly grease to prevent galling during installation.<br/>
<br/>
              7) 
            Remove from oven using insulated heatproof gloves,   oil the crank snout and promptly install using a professional damper   installation tool. </p>
<p align="justify"><strong>Note:</strong> If you don't have a damper installation tool,  stop by your local hardware store and pick up a 4-5" long bolt, a fender washer, and a nut, which are the same diameter and thread as your original damper bolt. Spin the nut all the way on to the long bolt, then slip on the fender washer, and finally your original damper washer. Once the heated damper is fitted onto the crank snout as far as possible (<strong>without hammering</strong>) thread the bolt assembly into the crank by hand. Make sure it goes into the crank at least an inch to prevent the threads from stripping (it takes a lot of force to install the damper). Spin the nut until the washer is snug against the balancer, then tighten  the nut with a box wrench until the balancer is fully seated. Remove the bolt assembly and install the  original bolt and washer, then torque to the proper torque specifications. <br/>
<br/>
<strong>NOTE: Never hammer a balancer into place, as it can  easily damage the crankshaft thrust bearings and seals. </strong></p>
