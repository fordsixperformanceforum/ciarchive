<p align="justify"><span class="style3B">In the past few years, other companies have produced aluminum cylinder heads for a limited market, such as an inline application, however  their cylinder heads were designed for maximum performance with little or no considerations being given to cost. As a result, the cylinder heads were very expensive and beyond the reach of most potential buyers. Hence the demand for such a cylinder heads drops dramatically, just after the initial release date, and production is eventually terminated after a short run. It is our belief that a reasonably priced, high quality cylinder head, which maximizes the performance within the given design ("best bang for the buck"), will maintain a much higher  demand   long after the initial release date. In others words, unlike other companies we are in this for the long run, rather than the fast buck.  </span>The following article documents the entire design process and our  results. </p>
<p align="justify">In the early stages, we spent several months doing extensive   engineering studies which would assist us in  making a decision as to the overall cylinder head design. This decision would be based on the initial design parameters,  our desired performance goals, and our target price.  <br/>

              We 
              began by establishing the design parameters

<p align="justify" class="style3B">Once the basic design was selected we needed to     re-established the design parameters. Our primary  concern 
              was to produce a 
              cylinder head which would meet   most (or all) of our original design parameters, while    maintaining the target  price. Thus keeping  our cylinder head   affordable and within the budget of our customers. </p>
<p align="justify" class="style3B">To do this, we   needed to keep the three main parameters in mind. First the new head needed to utilize existing exhaust port   patterns, thus eliminating new
              header designs. We also wanted to split the 3rd and 4th ports to eliminate  the need for a port divider. Next we wanted to maintain the stock 
              OZ250-2V intake pattern so our aluminum cylinder head would accept the stock 2V intake, as well as any existing  aftermarket intakes. This  includes   the triple SU 
            and  Webber manifolds.  This will assist in  reducing the overall cost of producing intake manifolds and gaskets, as well as satisfying the needs of our Australian customers. Last but not least, we wanted  to maintain the stock valve cover and rocker arm designs, allowing our customers to use their existing rocker assemblies and valve covers. This would greatly reduce the  customers initial out of pocket expense, thus making  it more affordable. </p>
<p align="justify" class="style3B"> While we  
            obviously wanted to see improvements in the  upper  rpm ranges, our final goal was to increase low and mid range   performance as much as possible.  This would require designing  intake ports large enough to flow the desired CFM's, yet small enough to maintain the  velocity needed for excellent throttle response. We  also needed a combustion chamber that was designed  for maximum   efficiency, as well as performance. If we could accomplish these goals, the end result would be a  cylinder head that was well suited for   daily drivers and  weekend warriors alike, at an affordable price. <br/>
<br/>
<u class="style4B">UPDATE 6-22-05</u></p>
<p align="justify" class="style3B"> I spoke with the design engineer today   and after doing  months of research we both came to the same conclusion. While a cross-flow cylinder head was the most desirable, it was going to be   to expensive to produce 
              and keep within the targeted price. Hence the decision was made to 
              base our new aluminum   cylinder head  on the old, but proven <a class="style4Y" href="OZ250-2v.html">OZ250-2V</a> design. With the decision made, we could  finally move on to the next step, which is designing the intake ports and combustion chambers using computer simulation programs. </p>
<div align="left"><span class="style11"><strong><u><a id="7805" name="7805"></a></u></strong></span><span class="style4B"><strong><u>UPDATE 7-8-05</u></strong></span> </div>
<p align="justify" class="style3B">Not knowing the wet distribution pattern   
              of the cast iron heads, we were uncertain of the gains we could expect.  
              However flow   testing the 
              US and OZ heads, both wet and dry, would give us  the answers. We also used the computer simulation programs to see what was going on inside the combustion chambers, which is really amazing stuff.    <br/>
<br/>
              Our first step was to  physically flow test both   cylinder heads, to find their strengths and weaknesses.  As expected, the 
              Oz intake ports flowed considerably better than the US log heads, while the exhaust ports, which are of the same design, flowed nearly identical numbers. Combustion chamber efficiency was  also very similar between the two heads, with a  wet distribution pattern around  fifty 
              percent. Basically when   the fuel/air mixture enters the combustion chamber it flows off to one side, filling less than    half 
               of the chamber, which  results in  huge losses of power. Both cylinder heads also required  large amounts 
              of total ignition advance to burn the   fuel/air mixture, somewhat efficiently, during the power stoke. Since  power output is decreased as ignition advance increases, the primary  goal is to   reduce the total 
              ignition advance, while simultaneously increasing the    CFM capabilities. The secondary goal is   improving  port velocity for maximum bottom end   torque and performance. </p>
<p align="justify" class="style3B">With the flow testing under our belt, the next step is to redesign the  intake ports and combustion chambers to obtain the best possible wet distribution pattern, or WDP. Most people, myself included, think the most important step is to increase the CFM capabilities, however this simply isn't true. The  most important step  in designing a new cylinder head is obtaining the  best distribution pattern possible, even if it means sacrificing CFM.   It doesn't do   much 
              good to increase flow, if the fuel/air mixture isn't distributed   efficiently across the piston surface, and/or the total ignition timing remains   unchanged. Therefore our goal was to increase WDP to  80%, if possible. This is   done  by modifying and reshaping the intake ports and/or combustion chambers. By increasing   intake velocity, eliminating dead 
              spots, manipulating swirl patterns, and   playing with various valve combinations, we were able to improve the WDP considerably. While there are other 
              means of   doing so, like chamber styles, additional valves, valve placement, and so on,  these   options were 
              not possible with our given design   limitations.</p>

<p align="left" class="style3Bl"><strong><u><a id="91405" name="91405"></a>UPDATE 9-14-05</u></strong></p>
<p align="justify" class="style3Bl">After working on the new port and chamber designs for several weeks, we were finally ready to flow test them using a computer simulation program, the new intake port and combustion chambers achieved 100% distribution, which exceeded my expectations.  This means the   entire chamber is receiving 
              the fuel/air mixture across the entire piston   surface, which is  outstanding. This alone translates
              into huge   power gains over the cast iron heads, at all rpm ranges. While we   are not sure 
              yet,  the total ignition timing could  be reduced by as   much as 10 degrees, or more. The  compression 
              ratios should also  be able to be increase to 11.5   due to the excellent quench factors of the new chambers. </p>
<p align="justify" class="style3Bl">The new intake ports were flow tested for CFM rates. While were not ready to release the CFM rates at this point, we will say 
              the new   ports out flowed the old designs across the board, with the largest gains   between .200 and .400, 
              and ample gains at .500 to .600 lift. In other words,   the new head is going to be a beast, when compared 
              to the OZ250-2V, and   incomparable to the US log head. Our next step,   which begins next week, is to see 
              what gains can be made to the exhaust   ports. Our goal is to reach a minimum of 65% of the intake flow,
              with 80%   being the ultimate goal. But is it possible within the limitations of the stock   port locations? </p>
<p align="left" class="style3B"><u><span class="style4B"><strong><br/>
<u><a id="11805" name="11805"></a></u>              UPDATE 11-8-05</strong></span></u> </p>
<p align="justify" class="style3B">I spoke to the engineer again today and the design work is finally completed.   Again, he exceeded my 
              hopes and expectations by bring the exhaust flow up to   73% of the intakes. This is outstanding and far 
              exceeds our original   aspirations.The design will work extremely well N/A or with   boost, and is perfectly
              suited to a roots style blower. With the high   velocity ports, fast burn chambers, excellent quench, 11.5 CR capability, 100%   fuel distribution, and increase flow, this thing is going to be awesome. </p>
<p align="justify" class="style3B">We should be able to start the pattern work late next week and are shooting for   an early to late spring
              release date. Once the first proto type is produced   and we verify the flow numbers, I'll release more info 
              on the flow numbers.   The new head will also require an upgraded exhaust system due to the   increase
              in flow and efficiency. A minimum of 2" dual exhaust pipes are  recommended. Bottom 
              end torque will come on fast and   strong and will keep on going thru mid range into the upper RPM's. He 
              NAILED   the design and exceeded our original specs. I couldn't be more please with the   results. I can't 
              wait to dyno the first head, which will be video graphed,   burned on a C/D, and offered to prospective buyers.</p>
<p align="justify" class="style3B">After going though all this, it has become very clear why   it was so important to do all the work that we
              have done. Especially the wet   flow and swirl testing. We had the option of simply reproducing the stock 
              cast OZ250-2V   head, but I felt it was crucial to take it to the next level and spend the money   required to accomplish 
              our goals, rather than settling for 
              a half baked   cylinder head. Hopefully you will all agree. I've heard that 
              there are other   companies out there looking at re-poping the cast head in aluminum, but I   seriously doubt
              they will go to all the effort we have extended in this   project. Remaking an existing design in aluminum is beneficial, but merely   changing the port and/or chamber designs with out the research, is a gamble on   the products end result, at your expense. </p>
<p align="justify" class="style3B">When we are ready to market the new head, we will provide all of the information   you need to do a 
              comparison to the current heads available. Nothing will be   held back, we don't believe in hiding
              the information. We want you to know   the facts, all of them, not just what we see fit to present. Why, 
              simply   because we know we will have the best cylinder head on the market. We want to   show off our new 
              motor at the same time. We have built a test engine (273ci)   that will blow your socks off. Even now, the
              dyno runs are amazing, but we   can't wait till the day comes when we can coupled it with the new head. 
              Could be, the Vee-Eight guys will be swapping back to an inline six. </p>

<div align="justify">It's taken a long time to get to this   point, but we have finally produced the first proto-type cylinder head, and flow tested it   to see just how well we did with the new port designs. With high velocity ports, fast burn chambers, excellent quench and fuel distribution   patterns, the new cylinder head should provide a performance level equal to, or better than that of most   streetable small block vee-eight's. </div>
<p align="justify" class="style3B">We conducted flow test on the   new aluminum head, and a stock cast 250-2V head, for comparison. It is easy to see   the improvements in the flow, on both the intake and exhaust ports. Considering  the exhaust ports were not   change when they designed the 250-2V head, only the intake ports,  the exhaust   flow for the cast 250-2V   heads and  a stock US log head are exactly identical. </p>
<p align="justify" class="style3B">For our flow test we used 1.84/1.50 valves. The exhaust valves used for the flow   test, were the closest (shelf item) valve available. However   the production head will use a custom 1.55 with a 20   degree back angle. This custom size valve is   being produced by SI   Valves, exclusively for the new FSP/CI aluminum head. By using the larger exhaust valve, we   should be able to increase the exhaust flow so that   it exceeds the 170   mark, which is well past   our original goal.  </p>
<p align="justify" class="style3B">The intake flow at   100-200 was slightly lower than the cast head, but it really comes on just after  the .200 mark. Note that the   cast head saw no increase in flow after .400  lift, thus limiting top end   horsepower. Given the excellent   torque output of the small six at low rpm's, we were more than willing to trade   a little low end flow for the   substantial increases  achieved in the mid and upper ranges. However, with the new high velocity ports, we doubt there will be any decrease in low end power, in fact we expect just the  opposite. To our   knowledge, the best intake flow numbers using a log   head were around 130cfm, but that has not been confirmed. <a id="cfm" name="cfm"></a></p>

<p align="justify" class="style3B">As seen in the picture graphs below, the new aluminum head   flows nearly the same cfm as two notable V8 cylinder   heads, which are able to utilize bigger valves due to their larger bores. However, the  flow improvements over the OZ cast iron head and a ported US log head are  evident. It is also easy to see the substantial gains in the exhaust flow, when compared to the US log or OZ cast iron heads. </p>

<p align="justify" class="style3B">The exhaust ports   show a substantial increase in cfm across the board, resulting in  a excellent flow ratio through out the entire rpm range. This is difficult to achieve in any cylinder head design, and was a major fault of both the US log and the OZ250-2V heads. Increases in excess of 50 percent are realized in the high lift ranges, making it especially well suited for turbo charging, as well as supercharging. Needless to say, we are very pleased with the results. </p>

<p align="justify" class="style3B">The second proto type cylinder head arrived, and is pictured below. We still have some minor issues to deal with, as  the placement of the exhaust ports is a bit high and doesn't allow enough clearance between the intake and exhaust flanges. Therefore the patterns need to be sent back to the pattern makers for the modification. They will  lower the exhaust ports fifty thousands and add a bit more material to the face, to achieve  the necessary clearance between the exhaust and intake flanges.</p>
<p align="justify" class="style3B">While they have the pattern, the third proto type will also see the addition of injector pads on 
              the top of the intake runners.  These  will need 
            to be machined by the customer if injectors are to be installed, for either  fuel injection or NOS. If injectors are not used, or installed in the intake manifold, the pads could  be used  for multi-carb linkage, throttle cable anchor points, or other needs. </p>

<p align="justify" class="style3B">Raising the intake runners to allow room for  the new port designs, also  required raising the stud pads. This modification requires  a custom ARP stud/bolt set, with the studs or bolts being approximately one inch longer on the intake side only. It also required raising the valve cover   walls to achieve adequate clearance between bolt head, or nuts (studs), and the bottom rim of the valve cover. However it will not effect the use of stock valve covers, and  provides additional clearance for high ratio  rocker assemblies. </p>

<p align="justify" class="style3B">Producing  three proto type heads allowed us an opportunity to do  visual inspections and mock ups on each. And in each case, we discovered small issues that needed to be dealt with before proceeding to the next step. All these changes take time, in fact several  months, however 
              we feel we finally have all the  issues handled and are now ready to produce a small batch of cylinder heads for testing. A dozen heads will be produced and shipped to various  FordSix forum members so they can be installed and tested in real world conditions. We will also be running our own motor on a dyno for at least one hundred hours. Once the heads have been tested and we are certain no other changes need to be made, we will begin the production run. Once the approval is given, it will take approximately six to eight weeks to cast and machine the production heads, which will result in a release date  sometime in late February or early March. </p>
<p align="justify" class="style3B">While this is  several months behind schedule,  we needed to be certain all the details were correct before investing thousands of dollars in a production run. Hopefully our customers understand our dedication to perfection and our desire to produce the best cylinder head possible. As I've stated many times, we simply refuse to take shortcuts or look for cheaper methods of production, which would result in  an inferior product.</p>

              For those enthusiast that are   interested in going beyond natural aspiration, we will be developing turbo and supercharger kits, which will   include an inter-cooler when applicable.

<strong><u><span class="style11"><a id="latest" name="latest"></a></span><span class="style4B">UPDATE   09-09-07</span></u></strong><br/>
<br/>
            It's been several months since we posted an update, so here we go. We received a  dozen proto type cylinder heads earlier this year (07) and sent a few out to forum members for field testing. Their comments are posted in the  Dyno &amp; Field Testing section. We also installed one on McLearran Racing's turbo charged 63 Falcon, which is sponsored by Classic Inlines. In short, the average ET's with the modified log head were  in the mid to low twelve's. With an OZ 250-2V cast iron head, the times dropped to the mid elevens. The first race with the aluminum head, we dipped into the high tens, with a 10.95 run at 124mph. <br/>
<br/>
            We took the Falcon to Portland in August for the Dearborn Classics West Coast Ford Championships, only to blow the motor on Saturday turing a test and tune section. However, we were getting it dialed in, running low elevens, and were quite sure the Falcon would have ran its best ET's to date that Sunday. But it was not to be. <br/>
<br/>
            We're now in the process of rebuilding the motor, which had a cracked  wall in the number five cylinder. We had planned for a cam swap in the old motor, so the new block will get a solid lifter 292 cam, instead of the old H274. We were hopping to have it ready for the Speedworld race in late September, but it looks like it won't be ready in time. However we will be racing in Tucson late October, for  the popular TV show PINKS, and hope to run mid tens or better.  </p>
<p align="justify" class="style3B">Last week we received good news and headed down to LA to pick up the first two proto type 2V/4V intake manifolds. We spent one morning with the pattern maker, going over the intake, plans for the triple Weber intake, and worked on a carb adaptor for the proto types. I wanted to try using a phenolic spacer as an adaptor, rather than aluminum, but wasn't sure if it would be strong enough for daily use. However, after machining and mounting a spacer, we both determined it should work just fine. We may switch to a pressure molded phenolic spacer for the production units, but still need to do a little research to make sure they will work  OK.     <br/>
<br/>
<img border="1" height="229" src="gallery/fordinlines/Aluminum/images/intake19w.jpg" width="572"/><br/>
<br/>
              The new intakes were based on the old cast iron OZ 2V intake, but have been modified to suit our needs. The new intake runners reduce in size over the length of the runners, unlike their OZ counterparts, which will result in increase port velocity for better throttle response at lower rpm's. We also made the intake universal, so the carb adaptors can be mounted in any position, thus allowing the carb's to be mounted parallel or perpendicular to the crank, depending on the application. We can also make an adaptor for mounting a single throttle body for fuel injection applications. <br/>
<br/>
              The proto type intakes do not have a water box, as they are still working on the molds. However they will be cast into the production intakes and will utilize threaded nipples.  While the old cast OZ 2V intakes bolt up to our aluminum head, the intake ports do not line up as they should. This is  result of moving both the intake and exhaust ports during the design stage, to optimize the air flow numbers, as well as making the new ports slightly smaller for improved velocity. The mismatch results in an 1/8-3/16" crescent shape ridge in each  of the intake runners, which  os obviously creating massive amounts of turbulence. Therefore when we install a proto type intake on one of the test motors, we should see a definite improvement  in performance. <br/>
<br/>
<img border="1" height="220" src="gallery/fordinlines/Aluminum/images/intake29w.jpg" width="572"/><br/>
<br/>
            All in all, we are very pleased with the new intakes and look forward to receiving the production manifolds in a month or two. While the old cast 2V intakes are interchangeable with our new intakes, we should point out they will need to be port matched for the best results and optimum performance gains.
