<td><div align="justify" class="style3B">Bang for the buck, the Duraspark II distributor is   hard to beat as a triggering devise for an electronic ignition system. Coupled   with either the sock ignition box or an aftermarket control box (such as as   the <a href="http://fordsix.com/proddetail.asp?prod=DUI%2D200%2DIGN">Dyna Module</a> or MSD-6A) it is a tough, readily available, reliable distributor. <br/>
<br/>
                      Ford began   using electronic ignitions in 1973 and introduced the Duraspark II system in   1976. The biggest change, apart from the control box redesign, was the large   distributor cap to handle the increased spark energy. The system consists of a magnetic reluctor and pickup in the   distributor, and an ignition module to trigger the coil. Typically, the   distributors have both mechanical and vacuum advance mechanisms. The curve is reset by   using inexpensive springs and adjustable advance units. They are found on both   200 and 250 engines and are interchangeable.<br/>
<br/>
                    They are a   direct fit on older 200/250 engines built after 1964 with the 5/16" oil pump   drive shaft. If you want to get one   from the auto parts store, make it easy on the clerk and just ask for a   distributor from a '78 or '79 Fairmont. Classic Inlines also offers a performance <a href="products9408.html?cat=111">DSII Distributor </a>and<a href="products9408.html?cat=111"> Complete Kits</a>, which utilize a full length bronze oil   impregnated bushing to provide increased durability and cure top   end timing fluctuations which are common in OEM DSII distributors. </div></td>

My 67 coupe uses the   MSD6A as a stand-alone with plug gaps of .050", my 66 coupe uses the Dyna Module and Inferno Coil with plug gaps of .055". <br/>
<br/>
The module needs to be mounted on an aluminum or   steel backing to dissipate heat, which also grounds the module. The   ignition wiring diagram looks daunting but its not really that difficult. Most installs only need two connections. The red wire which   is connected to a switched 12V source and the white wire which goes to the start   terminal of the ignition switch. The white wire is optional. When used it retards the spark a couple of degrees to reduce the load on   the starter (an enterprising hot rodder might hook   this up to a nitrous switch to retard the spark when the juice is   on). The Dyna and MSD modules come with wiring instructions, were not sure about the GM or Ford module, but would guess they do. If not, they can be found online, as many websites document the installation.</div></td>

<td><div align="justify" class="style3B">Here’s a rough drawing of the wiring diagram for  my 67 Mustang.  First lets cover
                  some 
                  of  the basics behind the wiring. The solenoid is a switch that powers both 
                  the  
                  starter 
                  and 
                  a full 12v to the coil.  The  switch is closed by sending 12v to the “S” 
                  terminal, 
                  so 
                  when you turn the  ignition to “start” you close that switch, sending 
                  power to the start 
                  and the  coil. Because the points could only handle 6v without 
                  burning up Ford installed  
                  a pink resistor wire, more on that latter. <br/>
<br/>
                  When starting the engine, the coil needs a full 12 volts. In order to do that,  Ford
                  bypassed the resistor during cranking.   When the solenoid closes it also sends 
                  12v
                  to the “I” terminal, through  the brown wire, and up through the red wire to the coil. 
                  While the engine is  running the solenoid 
                  is open, 6v is sent through the resistor, 
                  through the red wire, to the coil. It  also back-feeds 6v to the “I” terminal. <br/>
<br/>
                  NOTE: It is very important to remove the back feed wire, otherwise you  risk wearing
                  out the solenoid, which will send 12v back through the blue wire  and possibly burn
                up the wires under the dash. And everything else, including  your car.</div></td>

<td height="276"><p align="justify">So now that we have  an idea of how the old system worked, lets wire our new setup.
                  First make sure the battery is disconnected  and it’s safe to work.  Next pull the  ignition
                  out so you can work with it.  I  will not detail this step because of the many different 
                  setups there are.  Once out locate your pink resistor wire,  keep in mind after 40+ 
                  years
                  and multiple paint jobs it might not be so  pink.  Luckily for me mine was very 
                  well  marked.  Cut or remove the pink wire, if  you cut it make sure to properly end the wire 
                  so it doesn’t short anything  out.  Now you can either connect to a  12v ignition source 
                  to the coil or splice into a 12v wire.  Run this new wire, yellow 
                  in my diagram, through  the firewall and to the coil, if needed install the resistor that came with  Dyna Module kit. Keep in mind those  using other modules may not need this resistor.  Remove and cut the old wire running to the coil and remove the  brown wire coming off the “I” terminal, again making sure the wires are not  exposed.  Now lets test it all, you will  need a helper.  With the battery  connected turn the ignition to the run position.  Test to see that your getting 12v to the “+” terminal on the  coil.  Now disconnect the wire going 
                  to  the starter from the solenoid.  Have  your helper hold the ignition in the start position.  Again make sure your getting 12v to both the “+” terminal on the coil as 
                  well as the “I”  terminal on the solenoid.  If not you  car is worthless, if that’s the 
                  case I would be happy to buy it from you for  next to nothing.  If that won’t work 
                  for  you rework it and retest.  
                  If you still  can’t figure it out that’s what the forum is for.</p> </td>

Use the ones  from the donor, or get a set from your local parts store just ask for the wires  from the same vehicle and year you pulled the parts from, or a mid 70’s  Fairmont. This is  also a good time to  make sure you have a step colder than stock plugs gapped at .045 - .055.  Start with the lower number, drive it, and  decide if you can
                  go bigger.  When  setting your advance you may need some one to crank the engine over while you  adjust the distributor until you can get it in the ballpark. Set your advance  either using a timing light or even better a vacuum gauge. This can be done by connect a vacuum gauge  to a manifold source, disconnecting the vacuum advance and plug its source  starting the engine and rotating the distributor clockwise or counter clockwise  (counter clockwise for more advance, clockwise for less) until you get the  highest steady vacuum reading,
                  then back off 1-2 in Hg.  Shut down the engine, tighten down the  distributor hold down

                    First, remove the lighter of the 2 springs in the DII and replace it with one of the #925D   springs. DO NOT replace both springs with the #925D   springs (more on that in a moment). Next, there is a support arm that   holds the larger spring, on it's non-slotted end. Bend this arm in toward the center of the distributor, just 3/32   of an inch. <br/>
<br/>
                    This combination replicates the "police interceptor"   distributor spark curve for the 200 I-6, according to a local "guru" who helped build these for Ford in the early 1980s.   It causes earlier spark advance up to 1200 RPM,   which then remains steady until 1800 RPM, when the secondary spring starts its   advance. This "plateau" of early advance, limited by the 3/32" inward adjustment of the   heavier spring, provides more torque at around-town speeds. This improves your   MPG because you don't have to open the throttle as far to get the same speeds   you were running before. You'll also notice better off-the-line pep and   cold-running performance. Mine also starts a little better when hot, and the   plugs stay cleaner. My in-town MPG rose from 16.5 average to 18.1 average over 2 tanks of gas, winter driving to and from   work. I haven't tested the highway MPG yet, but I don't think it will improve from the 23+ I've been getting.   I'll re-post if it does. <br/>
<br/>
              If you make the mistake of replacing BOTH   springs in your DII with the #925D springs, you will get a SLOWER spark curve   unless you extensively modify one of them to provide a "slot", like the heavier   spring already has. But I found, even after that exercise, that the engine "hit   the wall" at about 2200 RPM and would not accelerate well up hills. Adding in   the heavier spring, but delaying its effect until 2000 RPM, did the trick:   now it loves to rev, even on regular gas (my compression is about   9.4:1). The maximum advance is reached at 2600 RPM on   my engine with this mod: before, the max advance was at 3200 RPM.</div></div>
